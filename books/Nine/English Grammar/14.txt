Chapter 14: Letter
Section 14/1: Informal Letters

Informal communication takes place in intimate circles, usually among friends and family, and formal communication takes place among people whose relationship is formal. In informal writing and speaking, we use lot of contractions such as I'm, you're; I've, I'd etc. Idiomatic expressions or phrasal verbs, exclamation, repetition, tag questions and use of slangs etc, are features of informal writing and speaking. The following letter is an example of an informal letter.

1. Read the letter and examine the features of informal style in this letter.

Dear Shuvro,

It's really, really good to be here in Sylhet. We got here on Saturday evening. The journey was HORRIBLE, the bus moved like a local bus, it stopped quite a few times to pick passengers. It was really irritating. It took twelve hours to get here! But the place we're staying is very nice – the surroundings are beautiful. I'm having a good time with my family now, but I miss you a lot.

It's now Tuesday afternoon and I'm sitting at a tea- garden chatting with some local boys. The weather is fantastic! It can lift your spirit.

With lots of love,

Rupom

2. Now rewrite the letter changing some words and expressions to make
it sound a little more formal.

3. Here is another informal letter. Read the following letter and say what
aspects of the letter make it informal?

Hi Stella,
It seems hard to believe that I've been here in Sylhet for a whole week
now. I promised to write and tell you how I was getting on-so here it goes.
When I first got here, I could not just get used to the new environment
with new friends, in new school. Now, though, I'm learning to take things
easy and I'm beginning to feel really at home. My first impression of the
Sylheti people is that they are really, really friendly and helpful.
I've managed to make friends with a few girls. The countryside round the
town is marvelous and very green, because it rains a lot here, but too
much of rain can really be boring.
Sorry this letter is short, but you know how bad I'm at writing letters. Do
write back when you've a spare minute. I miss you so much.
All my love,
Sumi

4. Now convert the letter into a somewhat more formal one.

5 Further tasks:
* Write a letter to your younger sister congratulating her on her success in the JSC examination.
* Write a letter to your younger brother advising him how to prepare for JSC examination.
* Write a letter to a friend inviting him to come and stay with you for a week during the school holidays.

• Write a letter to your friend narrating your experience of seeing a new film.
• Write a letter to your mother informing her that you had a bad cold, but now you are good after you took some antibiotic prescribed by a physician.
• Ask a friend to join your birthday party.

Review:
All personal letters are informal letters, but the degree of informality varies; some are highly informal, some others are semi formal. The informal letters are characterised as already mentioned above, by:
1. Use of colloquial words
2. Conversational tone
3. Use of contractions
4. Use of two word verbs
5. Use of slangs (in very intimate circle}

As mentioned earlier, degree of informality varies. For example,
When writing to parents, a letter may be a little less informal in its choice of words and tone than a letter written to a very close friend. Contractions and group verbs can be used with parents and other relations who are senior to us and whom we respect, like our uncles and aunts etc. In such personal letters highly emotional words and expressions and slangs should not be used.

A Read the following letter and see how a personal letter is also sometimes formal depending on the relationship. However such letters may have a conversational tone and hence, may be semi-formal.

Look at the following letter written by a son to his father.

Boys' Hostel
Collegiate school
Rajshahi
15 January 2017

Dear Father

I could not write to you for the last few days as I was too busy with my annual examination. As you know, our examination is over. Let me tell you that I have done well in all the papers. I hope the results will be good. However, as the new class starts from 7 January, I need to buy some new books. Please send me Tk. 2000.00 extra for the purpose. Also send money for my regular monthly expenditure for the month of January.

I hope everybody at home is fine. I phoned mum and Sumi yesterday and learnt about Rita's birthday party. May the Almighty keep you in good health! Please pray for me.

Yours,
Shuvro

Activity: How is the style of this letter different from the style of the preceding informal letters?

A formal letter is a letter that you write in formal situations, such as, a student writing to the Head Teacher/Principal of an educational institute for a scholarship or the waiver of the fees; a person writing an application for a job, or someone writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper; or any other kinds of business letter, such as an order or a complaint letter, etc.

In formal letters, no contraction, idioms or phrasal verbs, no colloquial or conversational style or tone is used. An objective, detached style is used in formal writings. Features of informal style mentioned above are not used in formal letters.

B Read the following letter of complaint.

House 2, Road 2
BIHAS, Rajshahi 6205
5 December 2015

The Manager
Quality Leathers
222/R.D. Market, Rajshahi

Subject: A complaint letter regarding customer service
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing to complain about a leather jacket which I bought from your store 3 weeks ago. I had tried a jacket on in the shop and checked it carefully before I decided to buy it. When I went to the cash desk, however, the assistant persuaded me to take one which was already packaged and assured me that it was perfect.
When I reached home and tried the jacket on, I found a large rip under the side pocket. As you will realize, I was extremely upset to discover this.


Page Number: 214
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

The jacket was very expensive, and I only bought it from you because of
your reputation for quality. In fact I always recommended your shop to
friends in the past. I was shocked.
I am returning the jacket with this letter and looking forward to receiving
an apology with a full refund of the cost, Tk. 2950.00.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,

Moinur Rashid

Note: A formal letter usually has 6 parts:

1. Writer's address and date on the top right corner

paces below the date in number 1.
3. The salutation Or (addressing)

Informal passage
A Discuss what makes the following passage informal.
Well, they had us take a look at the kids every day, and we'd write down lot of
things they did and said. There was this one teacher the kids really did things
for. This was because she was damn good at maths and could turn the kids on
to it. At the end of the week we all got together to talk about what we'd found
out since we got there. We all felt that you could pick up an awful lot about how
to teach just from watching what the kids did whenever the teacher told them
to do something.

B The passage below is the formal version of the above passage. How is
this passage stylistically different from the preceding passage?
We were assigned to observe the teacher daily to record their actions and
speech. What impressed us most was one teacher that the boys and girls
responded to eagerly because she knew her math thoroughly and made it
exciting. At the end of the week, when we met to discuss our conclusions, we
agreed that anyone can learn a good deal about teaching methods from merely
observing the children's responses to the teacher's directions.

Now find out the formal expression used in passage B for the following
informal expressions used in Passage A. In the blanks under Formal
expressions write down each informal expression.

**Activity 1**
Read the following passage and identify the informal expressions in it. Then change those with formal expressions.
One problem that plagues beginning teachers, and older teachers as well, is the seeming lack of self- control of underprivileged children. Because their homes are often characterized by an awful lot of fragmentation and instability, their behaviour reflects their inability to keep real cool in situations involving adults. .... We think it important, therefore, that the teacher be calm and understanding. For the teacher to be able to exhibit this kind of behavior when confronting a bunch of adolescents, he must have achieved terrific level of integration and security, so that his own psychic life is completely okay.

Each of the following sentences has expressions not suitable for formal writing. Underline those, and give the formal expression for it in the line provided against each sentence.
1. He has a lot of nerve. _________________________________
2. There were a bunch of kids. _________________________________
3. We got out of there in a hurry. _________________________________
4. I've got to get a move on. _________________________________
5. He is a pretty nice guy. _________________________________
6. War and Peace is an awfully nice book. _________________________________

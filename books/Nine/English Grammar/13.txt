Section 13/1: Basics of Changing Speech

A Read the texts below.

Context 1
Monika said, "You're late!"
(reporting speech) (Reported speech)

Mohammad said, "I expected that you would come on time".
(reporting speech) (Reported speech)

Farhana said, "We have been waiting for you for a long time.
We are hungry. ".
(reporting speech) (Reported speech)

"I'm really sorry. I'm hungry too. Let's go to a restaurant", said Soma.
(Reported speech) (reporting speech)

Direct speech

Context 2
We told Mithun that we were going to Sagardari to Michael's place.
She could join us.
Mithun told that without speaking to her mom she wouldn't be
able to decide anything.
Abid responded that was ridiculous as they all were grown up.
Mithun replied that it didn't mean they were out of any bindings.

Indirect speech

What differences do you find between the statements in Context 1 and Context 2?

Grammar Point
A reporting speech is the statement of the person who reports about something. We use reported speech when we are speaking or writing about something that another person said.

A reported speech is the statement what is being reported by a speaker. This statement is made by one person but reported by another person.

In direct speech we say exactly what was said or thought by others using verbs like said, thought, told shouted, etc. (as in Context 1).

The common feature of direct speech is
inverted comma (“….”) before and after the speech (made by other than who is reporting).

When we report what someone is saying or thinking now we use indirect speech after says, thinks, hopes etc. (as in Context2). Here we often use that but that is not obligatory.

Example
I was speaking with Ranjan. He says (that) he has just left Barishal.
We also use this form when we say about something that is always true.
eg. He says he doesn’t like band music.
or
Dipika says we can create a better world by loving each other.

B Now read these sentences.
We said to Mithun that we were going to Sagardari to Michael's place.
She could join us.
Mithun told that without speaking to her mom she wouldn't be able to decide
anything.
Abid responded that was ridiculous as they all were grown up.
Mithun replied that it didn't mean they were out of any bindings.
Abid hoped that her mom will finally allow Mithun to go.
I felt it wouldn't be that easy.
However we all wished good luck for Mithun.

Grammar Point
We use said to report someone's words/statements
We use told when we make its clear who the speaker was speaking to.

We can use verbs that express the feeling of the speaker when we report what
someone has said or thought. For example, hope, feel, be afraid, want, wish.

C Read the following conversations. How does the reported speech
change when they are made indirect from direct?

Direct
Boby : Hi Probir, It is good to see you in Facebook.
Probir : Hi Boby. Good to see you too. How are you?
Boby : I'm good. Well, I've got three tickets for the cricket match.
Would you like to go with me?

Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

Probir : Hmmm... I have an appointment with my doctor. I'm sorry.
Boby : Okay. Next time.

Indirect

Boby greeted Probir and told it was good to see him in the Facebook.
In exchange Probir also greeted Boby and said that it was good to see
him too. He asked Boby how he was.
Boby replied that he was good. He also told that he had three tickets
for cricket match. He asked Probir if he would like to go with him.
With hesitation Probir told that he had an appointment with his doctor.
He was sorry.
Boby replied that it was ok and hoped they would go together next time.

In indirect speech we report things that people say. We often use said and
change the tense of the verb of the speaker used in the following way:

| Actual words       | Reported speech    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| present simple     | past simple        |
| present continuous | past continuous    |
| past simple/       | past perfect       |
| present perfect    |                    |
| will               | would              |
| can                | could              |
| am/is/are/going to | was/were going to  |

Chapter Title: Speech

Grammar Point
In informal speech we sometimes use the same tense that the person used in the direct speech. Besides when we want to say something that someone says about future we use the same tense used in the direct speech

Example
Hannan: I'm going to Bandarban tomorrow.
Hannan says that he is going to Bandarban the next day.

13/2: Passage Narration

A Read the texts below to see how direct speeches are converted to indirect speech when they are placed in a passage which is commonly known as 'passage narration'.

Direct speech
Sales person: How can I help you?
Customer: Thanks. I'm looking for one of my friends working here.
Sales person: What's his or her name?
Customer: She is Sohana. Do you know her?
Sales person: Sure. And your name, please?

Indirect speech
The sales person asked the customer how she could help him (the customer). The customer thanked her and told he was looking for one of his

Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

friends working there. The sales person asked what his friend's name was.
The customer replied that she was Sohana. He also asked whether she
(sales person) knew Sohana. The sales person answered in the affirmative
and asked his name politely.

Activity 1
Compare both the speeches and find out the changes in the indirect
speeches by answering the following questions.
a. How do the modals change in the indirect speech?
b. How do the interrogative sentences change?
c. How do the yes/no questions change?
d. How do the information question (wh-questions) change?

Grammar point
We use ask + object + question word to report questions that ask for
information.
We use ask + object + if/whether to report questions that ask for the
answer yes or no.

Activity 2
Read the text with direct speeches. Change them into indirect speech and
write them in one passage following the clues.

Direct
'When are you starting for Burimari?", Moni said.
"The day after tomorrow', I said.
"Will you visit Dalia too?"
"I'm not very sure. I have some fixed programmes. They will occupy me the
next few days', I answered. 'But why are you asking me that?'
'I wanted to accompany you'. Moni said.
'Are you sure?', I wanted to know.

B Read the following texts.

Direct

Mathin told Lailee, “Listen to me. I’ve some important business now and so I have to go. Please come at my place in the evening.” “We will chat together and have tea together”. “How fantastic!”, said Lailee. I’ll definitely come.” I’m free in the evening. Can I invite Nikhil to join us?” “Wow! What a great interesting idea! I’m sure, he must be very happy to join us. Please ask him to join. Let’s have dinner together, not tea”, said Mathin.

Indirect

Mathin asked Lailee to listen to her. She had some important business then and so she had to go. Mathin requested Lailee to go to her place in the evening. She told that they would chat together and have tea together. Lailee expressed her joy (or exclaimed in joy) and said that it was a fantastic idea. She confirmed that she would go as was free in the evening. Lailee asked Mathin if she could invite Nikhil to join them. Mathin expressed her joy too and said - that was a great idea. She hoped that Nikhil would be very happy to join them. She then proposed that they would have dinner together instead of tea.

Activity 6
Identify the changes or differences when the speech is converted to indirect from direct speech and answer the following questions.

a. What do we use in place of said in the direct speech is an imperative sentence?

b. What do we use in place of said when the direct speech is an exclamatory sentence?

c. What could be used in place of said when the direct speech is an exclamatory sentence with a sad news?

d. What do we use in place of said when the direct speech begins with Let?

e. What change do you notice in the indirect speech for verb when the direct speech has Let?

Note that when we change direct speech to indirect speech we do not change word by word. We do some fine tuning to make the language lively. Otherwise it becomes mechanical and unnatural. This is why in the above indirect sentence it is written -

She confirmed that she would go as was free in the evening. We didn't write - She said that she would definitely come. She also said that she was free in the evening.

This type of fine tuning is important for changing speech from direct to indirect especially when you have a whole conversation to change.

Activity 7
Imagine that you went to your school the other day and there you met
your friend, Nandita. She told you about her friend. This is what she told
you:
Jibon and I have been friends for two years. I first got to know him at a
friend's birthday party. But we saw each other at another occasion before
that. He arrived at the party very late. He didn't recognize me when we first
talked. People were asking me to sing. He also requested. He wanted to sing
with me too. I told him I didn't really want to sing. Anyway, later I agreed.
Although he was a singer we sang together for some time. We didn't leave
the party till 10 pm. Later we met each other frequently and gradually we
became good friends. We have so many differences but we respect each
other. Sometimes we fight but we never leave each other. This is why our
friendship is so unique.

Activity 8
Now read the following speeches. The first one uses direct speech and the second one uses indirect speech. Underline the differences from direct to indirect speech. Then read the texts in the boxes to understand the changes.

Direct
It was a nice rainy morning. Bishu and Chimeg were seeing the rain through a window. Bishu asked Chimeg, “Do you have rains like Bangladesh?". "No", said Chimeg, "Mongolia doesn't have monsoon rain. Mongolia has winter. But sometimes we have little rain and they are unlike this rain. I have never seen such rain in my life." Bishu said, "I would like to get drenched in the rain. Will you follow me?" " Let us run", said Chimeg.

Indirect
It was a nice rainy morning. Bishu and Chimeg were seeing the rain through a window. Bishu asked Chimeg whether they (Chimeg) had rains like Bangladesh. Chimeg answered in the negative. She added that Mongolia doesn't have monsoon rain. Mongolia has winter. But sometimes they have little rain and they are unlike rain in Bangladesh. Chimeg also said that she had never seen such rain in her life. Bishu desired to get drenched in the rain and asked Chimeg if he would follow her. Chimeg proposed to run in the open field.

[Boxed text] The information here is a fact. So verbs do not change to past form

[Boxed text] When the same person speaks more than one time, we use added, continued, also said etc.

[Boxed text] If anyone wants to do anything, we can use desired instead of said

[Boxed text] "Let us run" - this is a proposal and we use proposed instead of said in the indirect speech.

Activity 9
Re-write the following story using the correct reported speech forms. Use say (that) ...., tell + object (that)...., ask + object + to infinitive, or tell + objective + to infinitive.

There was a wedding party beside my house and the people were enjoying music in loud volume. It continued until mid-night and that was too much. I went there and said, "There are many students and patients around. It is mid night as well. Please turn down the volume of your music. It is creating disturbance for all." One of them said, "It is a party. Who are you to tell us to turn it off? Leave the place and go home. Don't disturb us." I felt very offended. Finding no other alternative to make them understand, I called on the police by telephone. I said, "I'm speaking from Adabor area. It is mid night and some people are having a party with high volume music. I requested them to volume down their music. They insulted me and asked me to leave the place. Will you please come and do something needful?" The police said "Don't worry. We are coming in five minutes". After some time the police came and told the people, "It is time for people to sleep. Turn down your music or switch it off. You can enjoy your party without disturbing others." Then they switched off the music.

Section Title: Letter 15/I: Writing CV

All/most of you will have to write effective Curriculum Vitae, in short, CV, (called 'resume', in American English) for various purposes such as, to get a job or scholarship, etc. Writing a good CV is a skill all of you will need for your career.

The CV is meant to introduce you and your background to somebody who does not know you. It should present you in the best possible light, in a concise and well-structured manner. A regular CV for business purposes should definitely not go over one A4 size page. If one wants to use it for academic purposes and not for a job, the CV can pass that limit, and the additional space is used to describe academic activities, like conferences, publications list etc.

A well written CV shows first what is most important, but contains all relevant information. To this goal, it is advised that you adapt it to suit your target (specific type of job or scholarship). Pay attention to the order in which you present information in your CV.

Here is a guideline for writing a good CV. although there are a number of ways for writing CV, they agree on some common details.

The information you need to provide in your CV are:

Personal details: Here you should include your date of birth, contact address, telephone number and nationality. In case you have a permanent address different from your temporary address, include both. Personal details can be written with smaller fonts than the rest of the CV if you want to save space. You should write your name with a bigger font than the rest of the text, so that the reader can easily see whose CV s/he is reading.

Objective: You should state very concisely what you accurately want to do. Say something like, “To develop a career in .....”, or you can be more specific like “to obtain a position in ... where I can use my skills in...” You can write a few lines to describe that specifically, but keep in mind that you should show what you can do for the organization or company you are sending the CV to more than what the company can do for you. Writing a good objective is difficult, so take some time to think about what exactly you are going to write there.

Academic achievements: After your personal details, give details about your education. It is suggested that you present details about education in reverse chronological order i.e., you start with the latest degree and go gradually back. You should mention all your academic achievements including grades/divisions/classes. You should also mention scholarships and awards you received along with your achievements in co-curricular and extracurricular activities in your academic life.

Mention the scholarships if you have received any or other types of awards such as best student’s award, best debater’s award, award for poetry recitation, extempore speech, sports and games and so on.

Experience: Here you should include experiences, if you have any, relevant to the position you are applying for. You should show that you are a person who can take initiative, has creativity and is innovative. You should be able to convince the employers that you will be the best pick for the job.

Extracurricular activities: If you are writing a professional, and not an academic CV, you should mention activities/programmes you have attended/participated in.

Language Skills: You should also mention your level of competence in any language you know in all the four skills, i.e. whether you are average, good, very good or excellent in Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening in the languages you know.

Have a references section, where you should list contact details of 2 or 3 persons who would write letters of recommendation or reference letters for you. These are the usual components of a CV.

Section Title: 17/1: Characteristics and Types of Paragraphs

You have done a good deal of work on paragraph writing up to Class 8. Now reflect on your previous experience and note down what you understand about the following:
1. What is a paragraph?
2. What are the characteristics of a paragraph?

Activity 1
Read the following text and then answer the questions that follow.
In the dinosaur age the earth was infested by dinosaurs of different shapes and sizes. Some dinosaurs were very huge; they were heavier than dozen elephants. Some dinosaurs walked on powerful hind legs and stood as tall as palm trees. Still others had short legs, square bodies and were as big as army tanks. These dinosaurs had long horns and ugly, hooked beaks. Dinosaurs were so strange and terrible that other animals ran away from them in fright. The dinosaur age ended with the extinction of dinosaurs.
a What is the main idea of the passage?
b Which sentence states the main or the topic idea?
c Are the other sentences related to the main idea? Does the passage give an impression of unity or oneness?
The passage is an example of a paragraph.

Now read the passage below and note down the points made about a paragraph and its characteristics.
A paragraph is a unit of written discourse (may be spoken discourse also). It may be self contained i.e. complete in itself, or may be used as part of a longer discourse such as an essay or other assignments. The main idea of a well-written paragraph is usually expressed in one sentence. This is called the topic sentence. Then the idea is developed sentence by sentence. It is usually made up of a number of logically connected sentences written on one single

topic. Each sentence of a paragraph should be closely related to the topic, and
the paragraph should have a good structure with a beginning, middle and end.
An effective paragraph, according to Donald et al (1978) should have 3 major
characteristics which are:
• It develops one idea only, called the controlling idea or thesis
statement.
• It should have sufficient details to support the controlling idea.
• It should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, that is, it requires a
topic sentence, a body to develop the topic sentence and a conclusion.

* The beginning or topic sentence introduces the topic or subject of the
paragraph.
* The middle or body develops and provides support to the topic or
thesis statement.
* The conclusion or end sums up and reaches a conclusion about the
topic/subject.

Activity 2
Discuss in pairs or groups what the above text says about paragraph and its
characteristics.

Activity 3
Read the following texts and see which one is a paragraph and which one is
not. Explain why you think so.

Text A

Paragraphs can be classified in various ways. In essays paragraphs are classified into introductory, development, transitional, summarizing etc, types. Depending on the purpose of the writer, on the other hand, paragraphs may be classified into persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, narrative etc, types. According to techniques of development they can be classified into cause and effect, contrast, comparison, definition etc. types In short, these are the major classifications of paragraphs.

Activity 4
The following sentences are not in proper order to form a coherent paragraph. Rearrange them in a logical order. Put a number in the bracket against each sentence according to the sequence you would like to arrange them in.

( ) Last Friday was a frustrating day.
( ) But my father called me and asked me to type a few official letters for him before I went.
( ) It was my aunt from next door calling to check if I could give her some time.
( ) It was a beautiful, warm and sunny day. I decided to go out and enjoy the lovely weather.
( ) When I finished typing, I got up quickly and hurried towards the door.
( ) I got dressed, took my fishing rod, and got my bicycle out to go fishing.
( ) When I got back home, the sun had already set. I was still dressed to go fishing, and the cycle and the fishing rod were there leaning against the gate.
( ) Just at that moment, the door bell rang.
( ) She needed me to take her to the hospital.
( ) Her daughter, my cousin, has just given birth to a baby boy.
( ) As I took the cycle and the fishing rod inside the house I realized that I had spent the day doing things I never thought I'd do.

() I left the fishing rod and the cycle standing against a wall in the courtyard,
ready to go the moment I would finish typing the letters.

**Activity 5**
Look at the sentences below. They do not fit into one paragraph. They refer to
two different topics. Separate the sentences for two different paragraphs and
rearrange them into two logically connected paragraphs.
*   My first day in the new school was difficult.
*   There were some benches and an outdoor oven in the picnic area.
*   In the National Park of Shalna we found perfect setting for our picnic.
*   I got stuck in the traffic jam and reached school fifteen minutes late.
*   Everyone had gone to class and I found no one to ask for direction.
*   Nearby we found a football field, and not further away, a big pond where some of my friends went swimming immediately..
*   Twice I was embarrassed when I walked into classroom that was not mine.
*   Behind the picnic area was a forest where some of us went for a walk after lunch.
*   The building was so huge that it was hard to find my classroom.
*   Finally, I decided to go into my classroom
*   When I ultimately got to my class, I was almost in tears.
*   We liked the place so much that as we rode home on bus, we agreed to have next year's picnic in the same spot

Section Title: 17/2: Topic Sentence

Writing an effective topic sentence
A good topic sentence introduces the topic to be developed in a paragraph. It controls or limits the focus of paragraph, and once the focus is mentioned, there is no scope to go outside it. Anything outside its scope will be redundant or unnecessary. On the other hand, if the paragraph does not sufficiently support the topic statement that proves another weakness of a paragraph.

Remember that although the topic sentence usually comes at the beginning of a paragraph, it may sometimes come at the end or even in the middle of the paragraph. Sometimes the main idea of a paragraph can be so obvious that it need not be stated explicitly.

Activity 1
Read the following paragraph from a thank-you note and then answer the questions that follow.

You have made everybody in our family happy by giving me the raincoat. Sonia is happy because she won't have to lend me her raincoat again. Mother is happy because we have stopped arguing over who is going to use the one raincoat we have had. Father is happy because he doesn't have to buy one now. Even old grandpa is happy because now the house is quiet and he can sleep peacefully. I am the happiest person of all because you gave me a wonderful gift.

Chattogram are some other places of natural beauty worth visiting in
Bangladesh. The country has many other scenes and sights worth visiting
for local and foreign tourists.

b. Developments in Rural Transport System

A revolution has taken place in the rural transport sector in Bangladesh.
About a decade or so ago, there were hardly any mechanized mode of
transport in the rural areas; people had to walk long distances. Students
used to walk three four miles to go to school and another three four
miles of walking back home from school. Farmers used to carry their
goods either on their heads or by bullock or buffalo driven carts. But
with the improvement of roads in the rural areas, non-conventional
mechanized transports are seen frequently moving along the roads,
carrying both people and goods. This mechanized transport system that
includes engine driven vans, tempos, auto-rickshaw and the like have
changed the face of rural Bangladesh. The farmers can easily market
their products by using these transports. It has brought mobility in rural
life and it is largely contributing to the economic growth of Bangladesh.
Thus it is noticed that very significant change has taken place in the rural
transport system of Bangladesh.

Section Title: 17/3: Descriptive Paragraph

17/3: Descriptive Paragraph
Description is that kind of writing that pictures a place, a person, or an object.
In learning to write description, you should sharpen your powers of observation
i.e. train your five senses- sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Try to picture
for your reader the people, places or objects you are familiar with and have
observed carefully. This will help you describe them vividly by using details that
would appeal to your reader.
When you write a descriptive paragraph, tell who or what you are describing in
your topic sentence. Here is an example for you. Read the paragraph below and
look for details that appeal to the senses.

Activity 1
Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow:
The rainstorm was becoming more intense. Outside the wind roared and
raindrops splashed against the window panes. The wind rattled the windows
and slammed the shutters against the front of the house. Water began to drip
from the living-room ceiling in big noisy splashes. Then a loud burst of thunder
vibrated the house and made everybody jump. Five year old Rima hid her face
in her mother's lap and began to cry.

Which details in the paragraph above help you hear sounds? Which help you
see the rain?

Activity 2
A good paragraph helps the reader see something exactly as the writer sees it.
Think of details of your own to describe the following things. Try to use your
five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.
a The clouds in Autumn, or in the rainy season
b The star fruit
c Your favourite flower, or your favourite food

Describing People

A Read the following extract taken from Ernest Hemingway's story, The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber:

Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new. He was thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit.

Notice that the details in the above passage describe the physical features and appearance of Francis Macomber.

B Now read the paragraph below from another story, The Capital of the World, by the same author and see how it describes both the appearance and some of the nature of the person being described:

He was a well built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth and a skin that his sisters envied, and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile. He was fast on his feet and did his work well and loved his sisters, who seemed beautiful and sophisticated; ..... and he loved his work.

C Read the following paragraph and notice how the topic sentence expresses the main idea of the topic, i.e. my little sister acts like my big sister. And then notice how this is developed through illustrations or examples in the following sentences:

My little sister might as well be called my big sister. I'm twenty years old, and Urmila is only twelve. But Urmila acts like a sixty year old lady, not only with me but with everyone else in the house. She is regularly advising my father on what to wear, what to eat, when to take rest. My mother merely smiles when Urmila advises her on what to cook for the day or if the curry was a little too salty. Maybe we all pamper her a little.

and accept her adult acting. But last month when I came down with the
flu, I realized how precious she was to me. She sat beside me all the
time, putting an ice-bag on my forehead, bringing me water and fruit
juice to drink and often, in her usual manner, scolding me if I did not take
medicine on time. And all through those days she tried to cheer me up
by telling me the “little stories” of her life. That one time she really was
my ‘big” sister.

Describing a Place
D Read the following paragraph in which the writer is describing a street
in the early morning as he or she sees it.

A Street in Early Morning
In the early morning streets are scenes of serene beauty. I live on the eighth
floor of a high-rise building by a very busy street in Dhaka city. But in the early
morning the street wears a very different look. When I get up early, I often stand
on the balcony overlooking the street. The sun has just come up and its light
bathes the whole street with a golden glow. The street lights, after the night’s
vigilance, say goodbye as they are turned off. On the footpath the street dogs
that were awake all night curl up for a bit of sleep. On the other side of the
street, a few unfortunate homeless people pull up their torn bed sheets to

shade them from the sun and go back to sleep again. A car, with its headlights
still on, rolls by slowly as if sorry to disturb the morning calm. A few rickshaw
pullers paddle their vehicles slowly towards no particular destination. A tea stall
lights its fire and the smoke from it fills the quiet morning with heavenly mists.
A light breeze brushes my face as I stand there enjoying the serene beauty,
trying not to think of the noise and hustle of the day that will surely follow in a
few short minutes.

Activity 5

Write a paragraph describing a busy city street.

E Here is another descriptive paragraph. Read the paragraph and find
out the topic sentence, developers and terminator or concluding
sentence in it.

a) Rural Life in Bangladesh

The majority of the people of Bangladesh live in the rural areas. People live a
very plain and simple life. Majority of the rural people are farmers. They work
on their lands and earn their livelihood by cultivating their own land or working
on other people's land. They work hard from morning till night. Some of the
farmers are quite well-to-do, but there are many landless people also. The
affluent people of the rural community send their children to schools, colleges
and universities, but the poorer section cannot afford their children's
education. In most cases, their children become child labourers. They work as
day labourers in other people's houses or turn rickshaw or van drivers. These
days, most of them can, however, earn enough to manage two square meals a
day. Some of them go to the nearby towns and cities to work as rickshaw
pullers, garments workers, taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers. Whatever is the
amount of money they earn, they are happy with what they have. These days
the rural people have modern facilities of life too. Most houses have electricity,
television; the rich people also have refrigerators, improved sanitation system.

17/4: Narrative Paragraph
The purpose of narration is story telling. Narrative paragraphs narrate or tell
about some past incidents or events. The simplest kind of story is the kind of
writing that tells us about a series of actions, usually in time order, in a single
paragraph. A good narrative paragraph often tells us not only 'what happened'
but also 'how it happened'. While writing a narrative paragraph you should
keep in mind the following guidelines:
a present the subject in a topic sentence
b include information about the people and the setting
c tell the action in chronological order

Here are some examples of narrative paragraphs.

A Horrible Childhood Memory

Some of the past memories are not forgettable. Here I narrate one such memory of my life. I remember a fateful day when my friend, Sameer, almost got drowned. During our summer holidays, our school was closed. There was a big pond close to our home. My friends and I often went there to take our bath and have a swim. On that bright colourless summer day I had gone with my two friends, Sameer and Arif, to the pond. We got into water, swam for a while and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves. At one stage, when we were quite far away from the bank I heard Sameer cry out for help. He was going under water. At first I thought he was making fun, but soon I realized that there was something wrong. I saw Arif swimming toward Sameer. But Sameer was drowning, his body was under water. We could not find him. It was a serious situation; everybody was tensed. I was puzzled and could not decide what to do. Then I swam towards the bank and cried out to the passerby to do something to rescue Sameer. Hearing my shouts a young man rushed to the spot, took off his shirt and jumped into the pond within moments. He dived into the water, searched for Sameer a few times, and after about five minutes found him and brought him on the surface, and carried him to the bank in an unconscious state. We were still not sure about his condition. Then he shook Sameer in a special way for sometimes. After about 40 minutes Sameer had some movement and opened his eyes. It was a terrible experience of my life.

My First Day at School

I still remember my first day at school. A few months before I was taken to school, there was a kind of preparation in the family for helping me start a new chapter of my life, my school life. A new dress was tailored, a new bag and a few new books were purchased. (In)On a fine morning in January, my grandmother and my mother dressed me up for school, hanged my school bag with the books inside at my back, and my grandfather, who was excessively fond of me, held me by my hand and led me to school. It was

primary school about half a mile away from our home, not very far, but I
had never been there before. From a distance I could hear the noise of the
students learning their lessons in a loud voice, and there was a sound like
the singing of a chorus. When I reached the school, I saw a large number of
boys and girls sitting in five different clusters, each cluster was a class. I
could see them all, as there was no partition to separate the classes. I was
afraid to see so many boys and girls, and the noise they were making.
Moreover, the teachers were quite old and seemed rather unfriendly to me.
My grandfather took me to the Head Teacher for admission, completed
some formalities, gave me some advice and left me in the school. But five
minutes after my grandfather had left, I felt so helpless among these
strangers that I decided not to continue. Within moments, I took my bag
and started running after my grandfather. I managed to overtake him in a
few minutes, but he was surprised to see me thus run away from school. He
tried to take me back to the school, but I started crying piteously. This
moved my grandfather, who carried me back home. When I think of this
now, it provokes laughter.

17/5: Cause and Effect Paragraph
This type of paragraph begins with a statement of the effect first, and then goes on to give the causes that contribute to that effect.

A Read the paragraphs below and see how they begin, and what follows in the body and conclusion in each of them. Also find what is the effect and what are the causes in each paragraph?

1. Causes of Road Accidents in Bangladesh
Road accident is a regular phenomenon in Bangladesh. Many people die of road accidents every year; many others become permanently disabled, so it is considered a curse. Road accidents occur for various reasons. Many factors are responsible for road accidents. The most common cause is drivers without driving license. Many of the drivers in Bangladesh do not have driving license. Even if there is a driver with license, sometimes the conductors drive and the licensed driver take rest. Secondly, some of the drivers drive very recklessly and they try to overtake, which in most cases are one of the major causes of road accidents. Thirdly, many of the drivers overwork. They drive by day, and sometimes they drive night coach also on the same day, which cause much fatigue and the drivers feel sleepy which may cause serious accidents. Fourthly, mechanical troubles such as break failure, also cause accidents. The drivers, in many cases, do not properly check the engines before they start driving. Fifthly, there are too many buses on the roads. Moreover the roads are two-lane roads without any dividers. So, sometimes there are head-on collisions and sometimes the buses skid off the roads. There are other reasons also, but these are some of the major reasons of road accidents in Bangladesh.

2. Causes of Students' Failure in Examination
Many students fail in different public examinations every year. There are
many causes of students' failure. The main cause is lack of students' interest
in some subjects. Students do not enjoy learning and the system cannot
make learning interesting. The major motivation is to pass and get a good
grade, but beyond that, they do not seem interested in learning things for
their relevance in life. Students' motivation to learning is very poor.
Another important reason for students' failure is that the content students
are required to deal with does not seem to have any relevance for their
practical and professional life. Third important reason for failure of
students is that they study seasonally before the exams and neglect their
studies throughout the year. Moreover, teachers in the country are not
skilled enough to motivate the students and make their learning an
interesting experience. Besides, a need-based curriculum, as well as
meaningful and interesting textbooks for learners would improve the
situation significantly. However, without skilled teachers nothing would
take place as we desire.

3. Causes of the Spread of English as a Global Language
English has emerged as the major international language of the world. The
importance of English has increased many times in the present world. There
are many reasons for this. Firstly, interdependence of nations in the world
has also increased after World War II, for trade and commerce and for many
other purposes. Secondly, people are moving from one country to another
for education, tourism, diplomatic and other reasons. A common language
is required for interaction among people from different countries and
contexts, who speak different languages. Without a common language it is
difficult to perform different activities at the international level. English has

assumed the position of that common language. Thirdly, it has also become
the major library language of the world, as most of the library books in the
world are in English. Education of international standard is not possible
without good command of English as most of the books and journals in
libraries all over the world are in English. Fourthly, English is also the
language of technology. It is difficult to live in the present world without
computers, internet, facebook, twitter etc, which are used globally by
people across borders and English is the dominant language for those.
These are some of the major causes of the emergence of English as a
global/international language.

Notice that each of the above paragraphs begins with a statement of the
effect as topic sentence and then in the body of the paragraphs, the causes
are given.

Literary Genres/Forms

There are a number of major literary genres marked by their distinctive characteristics. First, Poetry is a major genre of literature marked by connotative, suggestive or ornamental use of language, rhyme, and rhythm. This makes poetry different from other genres of literature. Poetry again has sub-genres like lyric, sonnet, elegy, epic etc. Another major genre of literature is drama or play which is written both in prose and verse. Drama is primarily a performing art, not a narrative art, and is meant to be staged in a theatre. It is composed in dialogue, and is marked by action of the actors and actresses. Drama has subgenres like tragedy, comedy, tragi-comedy and history plays. The third major genre of literature is fiction

which is a narrative art, written usually in prose, has one or more narrators

**17/7: Comparison Paragraph**

This type of paragraphs shows similarities between two persons, places, things,
objects, actions or ideas. The topic sentence shows how we are comparing the
features or qualities of two subjects. To use this technique, we can have two
procedures:
a) We can compare two subjects' features or qualities point by point, or
b) We can state all the features or qualities of a subject first and then
compare these with those of the other subject.

Read the following paragraphs and see how it has been developed. Notice its
topic sentence, development and conclusion.

**A Paragraph and an Essay**

Despite differences in length, a paragraph and an essay have a number of
similarities. Firstly, a paragraph has a beginning which is the topic sentence
that introduces the topic. Similarly, an essay has a beginning called the
introduction which also introduces the key idea(s) of the essay. Secondly, a
2023


Page Number: 259
Short Composition : Paragraphs

paragraph has a body comprised of a few sentences called the developers which develop the idea introduced in the topic sentence. Similarly, an essay also has a body comprised of some paragraphs that develop the idea introduced in the introduction of the essay. A paragraph has a terminator or concluding sentence that logically draws the idea of the paragraph to a logical conclusion by restating the idea of the topic sentence. Similarly, in an essay, the concluding paragraph sums up the idea of the essay and concludes with reference to the idea(s) in the introductory paragraph. In addition to these, both have a sense of unity. The different sentences in a paragraph contribute to one idea stated in the topic sentence and thus create a sense of unity; the different paragraphs of an essay, similarly, contribute to the central argument of an essay. Thus a paragraph and an essay are largely similar structurally.

Read one more paragraph of comparison. Comment on its development

A Short Story and a Novel

Although different in length, a short story and a novel have many similarities. Both belong to the category of literature known as fiction; they are fictitious. Both of them have a story outline or plot. A short story has a setting, both time and space settings; similarly a novel also has time and space settings which contribute to the meaning or theme. Both are narrative arts and have story teller to tell the story. Both are written in prose. Both the genres have some characters, and episodes and both have themes. Thus, a short story and a novel have many similarities.

not vary among examiners for the same level of answers. Correct answer
will get full credits; wrong answers will be given no credit. So whoever the
examiner is from wherever, marking is reliable in this type of test. On the
other hand, essay tests focus on logical thinking, analytical skill and
creativity in presenting an idea, which are very important for all learners for
their intellectual development. However, marking is highly subjective in this
type of tests. Two examiners may award two different marks for the same
type of answers, or even the same examiner may award different marks for
the same level of answer if marking at two different times or on two
different days. Therefore, scoring of essay tests is not reliable. Thus the two
types of tests focus on different aspects, and both have their distinctive
merits and demerits and both are needed.

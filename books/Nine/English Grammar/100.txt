Guidelines for question setters and markers for English

1. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
MCQ can be set for testing a number of strategies and skills related to reading such as scanning, skimming, reading for gist, inferencing (guessing the meaning from the context) comprehension check etc. Each MCQ item will carry ½ mark. However, depending on the level of difficulty some items may have 1 mark as well.

In preparing MCQ item, question setters will make sure that learners have to apply certain skills or strategies of reading in order to be able to choose the right options. Depending on the level of the learners, items will be set to test learners' lower order thinking skills (knowing and understanding) as well as higher order and more critical thinking (analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating). Use synonyms in the questions to avoid quoting directly from the original passage. Make the questions a bit round about so that learners think.

For example :

Text : The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first built between 220-206 BC.

Question : When was the Great Wall first built? (Don't make this type of question. Student will just get the answer from the question paper as 'was born' is common in both the text in the question paper and the answer.)

Question : What is the initial construction period of the Great Wall? (This question is Okay as learners has to understand that 'was built' and 'construction period' are same.)

Students will write the question number and then write only a/b/c/d that refers to the correct answer. Whole sentence from the question paper is not required.

The same text can be used for guessing the meaning from the context and Question Answer (open ended and close ended). However, the same text cannot be used for Question-Answer and True/False. Depending on difficulty level and text length, information transfer and True/False questions can be set from the same text or from two different texts. Two different texts are preferred to a single text.

Please note the following points while setting MCQ test items :

* Phrase stems as clearly as possible. Confusing questions can generate wrong answers from students who do understand the material.
2023


Page Number: 311

Sample Question

*   Avoid redundant words and phrases in the stem. Extraneous details make a question more complex and less reliable.
*   Include any language in the stem that you would have to repeat in each answer option.
*   Options should be similar in length and structure.
*   The number of answer options should not be more than four.
*   Distracters must be incorrect, but plausible. Try to include among the distracters options that contain common errors.
*   To make distracters more plausible, use words that is familiar to students.
*   If a recognizable key word appears in the correct answer, it should appear in some or all of the distracters as well. Don't let a verbal clue decrease the validity of your exam.
*   Avoid using extreme or vague words in the answers. Use rarely extreme words like *all, always* and *never* or vague words or phrases like *usually, typically* and *may be* in the answers.
*   Avoid using *All of the above* or *None of the above* as an answer choice.

In designing MCQs the following guideline has to be followed.

**MCQ for grades 9-10**

Altogether 7 MCQs will be set. Each MCQ will have 1 mark for a correct answer. There will be 2 MCQs on vocabulary test (guessing meaning from the context and inferencing) and 5 MCQs on answering questions (skimming, reading for main ideas and supporting details, reading to infer meaning). Thus the marks distribution will be:

Vocabulary 1X2 = 2
Questions 1X5 = 5
Total = 7

**2. True/False**

True-false questions are typically used to measure the ability to identify whether statements of fact are correct. The questions are usually a declarative statement that the student must judge as true or false.


Page Number: 312
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

Follow the general guidelines below while writing True/False items for your students:
• Base the item on a single idea.
• Write items that test an important idea.
• Avoid lifting statements right from the text.
• Make the statements as brief as possible.
• Write clearly true or clearly false statements.
• Try to avoid such words as all, always, never, only, nothing, and alone.
• The use of words like more, less, important, unimportant, large, small, recent, old, tall, great, and so on, can easily lead to ambiguity.
• State items positively. Negative statements may be difficult to interpret. This is especially true of statements using the double negative. If a negative word, such as "not" or "never," is used, be sure to underline or capitalize it.
• Beware of detectable answer patterns.

3. Matching
There is no need of a separate reading text for matching. The question itself will have a context after the texts in part A and part B are properly matched. The numbering of texts in column A can be i. ii. iii, iv ..... and the texts in column B can be a, b, c, d........ Students only need to match the numbering in the two columns, e.g i, ii, iii, iv etc. (in column A) and a, b. c. d etc. (in column B). You can also use 3 columns with texts to match.

4. Gap filling with or without clues
The text in the gap filling activity is separate and complete. The text for this item will have a meaningful context too. There will be five gaps in the text. The gaps can be used for article, preposition, or any other parts of speech without verb as there is separate test for it. A question setter will choose one particular item mentioned earlier to set a question and use a gap at the particular place. For example, if the question setter wants to test the article then there will be a gap at the position of a, an, the or before a noun that does not take any article. For a question of 3 marks, there will be six gaps in the text; for 4, there will be 8 gaps; and for 5 marks there will be ten gaps.

Follow the guidelines while writing gap filling test items:
• Prepare a scoring key that contains all acceptable answers for each item.
• Prefer single word or short phrase answers.
• Beware of open questions that invite unexpected but reasonable answers.
• Make all the blanks of an equal length.
• Avoid grammatical clues such as "an."
2023


Page 313
Sample Question

*   Place the blanks near the end of the statement. Try to present a complete or nearly complete statement before calling for a response.
*   Limit the number of blanks to one or two per sentence. Statements with too many blanks waste time as students figure out what is being asked.
*   If a numerical answer is called for, indicate the units (e.g. currency) in which it is to be expressed.

5. Cloze test with/without clues
A cloze test is a fill-in-the-blank activity that assesses students' comprehension of vocabulary and reading passages or knowledge of grammatical items. In cloze tests there are recurrent gaps at every 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th word. If the first gap, for example, is used at the 5th place, all through the text the gap will be at the 5th place. Unlike the gap filling activity that tests a particular grammar item (e.g. preposition, article, pronoun, or verb) it is a test for vocabulary (key words) in general. This is why gap filling activity in the reading section is usually a cloze test. In contrast, gap filling activity is a merely a grammar test item.

A cloze test with 5 marks will have ten gaps (.5 for each gap). Considering the level of difficulty cloze tests without clues at grade 10 can have 5 gaps (1 mark for each gap).

In answering the question, an examinee does not need to reproduce the text in the answer script. Writing the missing word with the corresponding question number is enough. However, the whole text with suitable words in the gaps will neither earn any extra credit or discredit.

6. Information Transfer
Depending on the level of difficulty and length of the text, information transfer and True/False questions can be set from the same text. However, if the text is too small, do not use the same text for both the tests as the content will be inadequate for setting questions. Make sure there is no overlapping or repetitions in the question you have set. Alternatively you can use two different texts for these two test items.

The marks allocated for information transfer is 1X5 =5 or 0.5X10=5 (depending on the level of difficulty)

7. Substitution table
It's a grammar test item. It tests whether students can make grammatically correct sentences following any particular structure/s. It's different from matching item. In matching there might be equal number of texts in each column in a table and students need to make sentences using a text from each column. In designing the test item, the question setter can write the texts in Column A in a way so that the sequential

Forma-40, English Grammar and Composition, 9-10


Page Number: 314
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

8. Gap filling with right forms of verbs
Sentences will be written in context in the question paper. Some verbs could be omitted or given in brackets without any form. If the verbs are totally omitted in the text, a list of verbs will be supplied in a box separately. Students' job will be to use the verb at the gaps in their correct forms according to the context and other grammatical considerations. Alternatively base form of verbs can also be supplied in the body of the text in parenthesis.

Students will write only the right answers with the question number. However, if anyone uses the text with words at the gaps, it should be accepted as correct answer.

9. Changing sentences
A text will be designed with a certain context. Some of the sentences in the text will have instructions in the parenthesis on how to change them. Depending on the marks in the test item, students will be asked to change 5 or 10 sentences. Students will write only the changed sentence as their answers. They can write the changed sentences in any order but must use the correct number used for each sentence in the given text.

10. Rearranging
Rearranging measures students' ability to organize some detached sentences into a coherent and cohesive text. For SSC, Ss will rearrange eight parts of story/passage (See the sample question for SSC.). Test your test item (with someone else or you sit for a test) to check whether the sequence of the answer vary. If the answer varies and each variety has a complete meaning, redesign the test. Use linking words/sentence connectors to maintain cohesion and coherence in the text. Learners do not need to reproduce the text in their answer scripts. If they arrange the corresponding serial of the texts correctly (such as b. d. a, f or v, iii, vi. i ... etc), they will get full credit. Please remember that the test objective here is the organisation of sentences, not the copying of texts from the question paper. However if any learner comes with sentences written in a random text, there is no need to penalize him/her. Students will get credits for the correct answers. For example, if the answer is like this:
2023


Page 315

Sample Question

a. X b. √ c. √ d. X e. √ f. √ g. X h. X i. √ j. X the student will get 5 marks.

The test has no relation with the texts used in the previous test items.

11. Writing summary
Use a text not exceeding 300 words for classes 9-10 in the question paper. Learners will produce a summary using one third words of the given text. For an example, if the original text has 150 words, learners will produce the summary in 50 words. However, 5% plus minas is okay. This answer should be written in random texts not in isolated sentences. There is no question of counting number of sentences in summary. So do not mention in the question paper own many lines or sentences learners will use to make a summary. The number of words used here is important. Make sure that they are writing in their own words, not copying some sentences from the text. Practice them to avoid examples or explanations in writing a summary. A fresh text should be given to make summary. No text used in the previous test items can be used here.

12. Writing a paragraph answering questions
Make sure while answering questions your students will be guided to write a well structured paragraph. In other words, if the students answer the questions properly, there will be a paragraph of a befitting topic sentence followed by arguments/ideas to support the topic sentence and a conclusion to summarise what has been told in the topic sentence and the body. There cannot be any new ideas in the conclusion. However, if there are 5 questions to answer, it does not mean that students will write only five sentences. They will use sentences as per their discretion but the paragraph as a whole answer the questions. If there are 10 marks for this item, learners should be able to make at least 10 sentences. The word limit for classes 6-7 is 150 words, for class 8, it is 170 words, and for 9-10 it is 200 words at least. 10% plus minus can be accepted. Keep an eye on the content rather than the mechanical calculation of sentences. Assess the paragraph from different aspects such as grammar, ideas, organisation of ideas, communication, punctuation, and spelling. Do not assess the paragraph from the perspective of grammar accuracy only. Regarding the composition writing in Paper 2 (which is structurally an essay) the word limit will be 250 for classes 6-7, 300 for class 8, and 350 for 9-10.


Page Number: 316
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

13. Completing a story
There will be the beginning of a story in the question paper. Students will continue the
story and complete it. The answer will vary here. Completing a story when given at
classes 6-8 should be more guided (See sample question for classes 6-7.) where
question setter not only begins a story but also provides with some clues for the
extension of ideas. Students will complete the story following the clues. A good idea is
to mention the word limit when there is no clues for the students. Assess the paragraph
from different aspects such as grammar, ideas, communication, organisation etc.; do
not only assess the paragraph only from the perspective of grammar accuracy.
Moreover, use of cohesion (inter-connectedness of the sentences) and coherence
(transition from one idea to another idea) are important here. Word limit here will be
similar to paragraph writing.

14. Open-Ended Questions
Open ended or essay format questions are excellent for measuring higher level
cognitive learning and overall comprehension of a reading text/passage. They allow the
student to select content for their response, to organize their thoughts in a logical
manner and to present their ideas on a given subject matter. Overall, these types of test
questions allow teachers to test student's broader understanding of a reading item.
When writing good open-ended questions, keep the following guidelines in mind:

*   Be sure that the test question clearly states the answer that you are seeking from
    the student. For example, "Discuss the outcomes of environment pollution" is a
    poor test question. But, worded as "Describe the potential impacts of the
    environment pollution on the people of coastal regions in Bangladesh" or, what
    are the causes and impacts of environmental pollution on the people of coastal
    regions in Bangladesh? is a better test question as it clearly gives the student
    something to compare and contrast within a focused area.
*   If you are looking to test comprehension, a good opening line for the test
    question is, 'Explain the following..."
*   If you are seeking to test the student's ability to analyze a concept, a good
    opening phrase for your test question is, 'compare and contrast....."
*   Don't give students the option to pick 2 or 3 questions from among 5. This can
    add confusion for the students and complexity for the teacher when grading for
    a classroom. This type of test format often compromises with validity and
    reliability of the test.
*   Here you are setting recalling questions, design the question in a way so that
    examinees do not have opportunity to pick answers by matching the vocabulary
    in the question and answer.
2023

Sample Question

Question setters have to go by the following guideline in setting questions.

Grade 9-10

There will be 5 open ended questions each bearing 2 marks for the correct answer.
There will be 1 question to recall answer, 3 questions to check students' understanding,
1 question for analysing information or evaluating something.

A list of action verbs according to Bloom's Taxonomy for lower order and higher
order thinking questions are supplied here to be used while designing the test
items.

Remembering/recalling: describe, define, list, locate, tell

Understanding: describe, classify, discuss, explain, identify, select, translate, predict

Analysing: solve, use, interpret, sketch, illustrate, classify, differentiate, organise,
relate, identify, categorise, compare, contrast, construct, distinguish, explain,

Evaluating: argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, assess, justify

Creating: construct, develop, investigate, design, imagine, justify

(for more information please visit:
http://cft.vanderbitt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)

15. Dialogue writing

A dialogue in real situation is an exchange of information. This has to be reflected in
the dialogue written by the test giver. A dialogue cannot be a mere combination of
fragmented sentences or snappy phrases or collocations like Hi/Hello/Yes/No/Very
good/Thank you/Welcome/See you/Bye etc. There must be some questions and answers
in full sentences. A dialogue has to contain at least 5 questions and their answers or 10
exchange of statements including some questions in full sentences other than greetings.

16. Writing letters/e-mails

If it is an informal letter, content is important. If it is a formal letter, both content and
form are important. Formal letter can be written either in British style (each paragraph
indented at the beginning for one space, date at the upper right hand corner, name at the
right hand corner at the bottom). It can also be written in American style (All
paragraphs in a line without indenting, date name everything at the left hand corner).
Picture of an envelope or stamp is not needed but address can be written. Yet, if any
student provides them - it will not earn any extra credit or penalty.


Page Number: 318
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

For e-mails, student must write the e-mail id, subject, and content as written in a
genuine email. Students should be taught in the class that there should be a
considerable margin at the answer script. However, there should not be any penalty for
any examinee if the answer script has no margin. Margin has nothing to do with
assessment of the answer.

Word limit should be mentioned in the question paper. Again the word limit is 150
words for classes 6-7, 170 words for class 8, and 200 for classes 9-10 with 10% plus
minus.

17. Describing graphs and charts

Graph should be authentic. Teachers may collect charts from various sources such as
newspapers, magazines, books or from the internet. Alternatively, teachers can use
authentic data and make simple charts by themselves. Describing a graph or chart
needs certain language abilities. The graph and chart presented in the textbook show
that. A marker of answer scripts should keep an eye whether those languages are used

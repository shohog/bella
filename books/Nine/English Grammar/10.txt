Grammar point
Every sentence must have a subject, but sometimes the subject does not mean anything, like the introductory 'there' and 'it' in the above sentences. When we don't want to put a new information at the beginning of a sentence, we write it in a different way using there/it at the beginning. 'There' and 'it' at the beginning of a sentence are also called 'empty subjects'.

Notice that there/it is followed by the verb be.

Form : There +be e.g. There is ... /There are ...
There was .../There were ...
It + be e.g. It is .../ it was ...

Use
We use the introductory 'there' to say that something exists or existed in the past:

There is a lake in the university campus.
There were hundreds of migratory birds.

We usually use it to talk about something that we have already mentioned:

What's that bird? It's a Siberian duck.

We can also use it when we talk about:

distance : It's about 22 kilometers from Dhaka to Savar.

time : It was 7 a.m. when we started for Savar.
nature/quality
of a place : It's quiet and peaceful here by the lake.

We also use it + be + adjective to express our feeling about something:
It was wonderful to watch the migratory birds on the lake water!
It's important to share your feelings with your close friends.
It's good to know that you care for me.

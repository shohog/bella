Section Title: 9/1: Clauses

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate.
There are two kinds of clauses: independent and subordinate clauses. A clause may be either a sentence (an independent clause) or a sentence-like construction within another sentence (a dependent or subordinate clause).

A The Independent Clause

An independent clause expresses a complete thought and can stand by itself as a sentence. If you recognize a sentence, you should be able to recognize independent clauses.

Look at the following examples:

[Image of a tornado]

Many people are afraid of tornadoes.
A tornado can be terrifying.
A tornado is a violently revolving storm.
In the centre of the tornado is an area of calm air.
The centre of the tornado is known as the "eye".
This eye is formed by the air spiraling around it.
This eye is simply a hollow space.

All the above sentences are independent clauses. A sentence may have more than one independent clause.

Chapter Title: Sentences

For example,

A tornado is a violently revolving storm and it can be terrifying.

The centre of the tornado is known as the "eye", but it is simply a hollow space.

**Activity 1** Write down ten independent clauses about yourself.

B The Subordinate Clause

A subordinate clause is a group of words that has a subject and a predicate but cannot stand by itself as complete sentence because it does not express a complete thought. While an independent clause can stand alone as a complete thought, a subordinate clause cannot stand alone. Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent clauses.

Look at the following examples. Each sentence has two parts, and in each part there is a subject and a predicate. However, the second part in the first sentence and the first part in the second sentence cannot stand alone, and therefore, they are subordinate clauses.

The crowds cheered to greet Mashrafi *when he entered the stadium.*

*As he walked across the field*, he waved back to the audience.

Study the following sentences, which contain subordinate clauses. Notice that the subordinate clauses are introduced by words like *since, when, if, as, who, which* and *that*.

Luna, *who was the Roman goddess of the moon*, gave us the word *lunatic*

*Since at one time the moon was believed to cause madness*, people avoided moonlight.

Anyone *that slept with the moon shining in his/her face* might become mad.


Page Number: 128
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

Even today many people feel uncomfortable if the moon shines
in on them while they are sleeping.

(The examples above have been taken from Warriner's English Grammar and
Composition, 1973)

A sentence may have more than one subordinate clause. For example,
see the last sentence above.

B 1 Kinds of subordinate clauses:

A subordinate clause may function as an adjective, an adverb, or a
noun.

i) Clauses used as adjectives: A subordinate clause functions as an
adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun. Such clauses are
sometimes called adjective clauses.

Look at the following sentences. The subjects of the subordinate
clauses are underlined, and the predicates are shown in bold type.

The movie that you recommended to me was good.
( Which movie? The one that you recommended to me.)

A doctor who takes care of children is a pediatrician.
(Which kind of doctor? A doctor who takes care of children.)

In the above sentences, the subordinate clauses, that you
recommended to me, and who takes care of children, are adjective
clauses.

Most adjective clauses begin with a relative pronoun:

that which who whom whose
2023


Page Number: 129
Chapter Title: Sentences

You may also introduce adjective clauses with relative adverbs:

*after before since where why*

for example: It was a place *where* crowds gathered in the evenings.

(Subordinate clause)

ii) **Adverb Clauses:** A subordinate clause functions as an adverb if it modifies a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Such clauses are sometimes called *adverb clauses*.

Here are some examples of adverb clauses:

*Before you buy a television*, you should compare prices.
(modifies verb)

Aleya was *proud that the theatre group chose her*.
(modifies adjective)

Like adverbs, adverb clauses tell how, when, where, and to what extent. They may also explain why.

Look at the following sentences:

How The building *swayed as though it would collapse*.

When *Before the storm started*, Nayan took shelter in a building.

Where We can have lunch *wherever you want*.

To What Extent Maya studied the poem *until she had memorized it*.

Why Shahed came early *so that he would get a good seat*.

Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

iii) Noun Clauses: Some subordinate clauses function as nouns in sentences.

Such clauses are called noun clauses. A noun clause may function as a subject, a predicate nominative, a direct object, an indirect object, an object of a preposition, or an appositive.

Examples:
Subject  That he is generous is evident.
Predicate Nominative That is what we decided.
Direct Object I don't know where Seema is.
Indirect Object Give whoever is coming a message.
Object of a Preposition I was criticized for what I did.
Appositive The subject of my speech, that taxes should be lowered, was well received.

You may introduce a noun clause with either an interrogative pronoun (such as, who, whom, whose, which, whatever, whoever, whomever, etc.) or, a subordinating conjunction (such as, how, that, when, where, whether, why, etc.)

Activity 2

Section Title: 9/3: Sentences: Structures and Types

In the previous lesson you have learned that sentences may be classified according to their purpose or meaning: assertive (positive/negative), interrogative, imperative and exclamatory. Another way to classify sentences is according to their construction, the kind and number of their clauses.

A The Simple Sentence

A simple sentence has one independent clause and no subordinate clauses.

Look at the examples of simple sentences below. Notice that a simple sentence may have a compound subject (sentence 2) or a compound predicate (sentence 3) or both (sentence 4). A compound subject consists of two or more connected subjects that have the same verb. A compound predicate consists of two or more connected verbs that have the same subject.

1 Bangladesh has some beautiful tourist spots.

2 The tea gardens in Sylhet and the forests of the Sundarbans are favourite tourist attractions. (The two parts of the compound subject have the same verb, are.)

3 We planned to go to Syhet but then went to the Sundarbans instead.

4 Paban and Sara brought some bananas and fed the monkeys.

B The Compound Sentence

A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses but no subordinate clauses.

The independent clauses are usually joined by some connecting or linking words such as, and, but, or, nor, for, yet, however, therefore, etc. We can also join the independent clauses by using a semicolon.

Following are some examples of compound sentences:
I like jogging, but I like swimming better.
Razzak graduated last year, and now he works in a private bank.
I wanted to go to the concert, but I didn't get the ticket.
The giraffe has a long neck and long legs, but it is a very graceful animal.
Fruits and vegetables should be a part of everyone's diet, for they supply necessary vitamins.
It was a good day for outing; I went cycling in the countryside.

C The Complex Sentence

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.

We had lunch at the student cafeteria when we visited the college.
He gave her a pair of bangles which belonged to his mother.
While we walked along the beach, it started raining.

Section Title: 9/5: Tag Questions

A Read the following conversation:
Sam : It's a nice party, isn't it?
Zinia : Yes, it is indeed. We're going to stay the whole night, aren't we?
Sam : I think so. By the way, I haven't seen you for a long time.
Zinia : I was in the USA for six weeks.
Sam : Oh, really? You didn't go there on business, did you?
Zinia : No, I didn't. Actually I went there to attend my brother's graduation ceremony.
Sam : You are not going away anywhere soon, are you?
Zinia : No, I'm not. You missed me, didn't you?

If we study the above sentences, we notice that each of the sentence ends with a question. These questions are different from the wh-questions or 'yes/no' questions. These are called tag questions.

We also notice that, if the statement is affirmative, the tag question is negative. If the statement is negative, the tag question is affirmative.

So, a tag question is a kind of question asked by the speaker after a negative or an affirmative statement during conversation. They are normally used in speech when we want to:
* confirm that something is true or not, or
* to encourage a reply from the person we are speaking to.

Forma-19, English Grammar and Composition, 9-10


Page Number: 146
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

1. Intonation and meaning:
When a tag question is spoken, the voice can go up or down.
It is a nice party, isn't it?
A falling intonation means the speaker is sure (or almost sure) that the statement is true. He/she only wants to confirm. The tag is not really a question.
A rising intonation means that even though the speaker expects to hear 'yes', the speaker is less sure and wants to know.
You didn't go there on business, did you?

B Why do we use tag questions?
We can use tag questions to verify or check information that we think is true, or to check information that we aren't sure about.
The interesting things about tag questions are that they have varied uses. The tag question is in fact a typical feature of conversation in English.

Different uses of 'tag questions':

C Read the following tag questions:
You have known Shumona for a long time, haven't you?
Shumona is Bangladeshi, isn't she?
She lives in Dhaka, doesn't she?
She has lived here all her life, hasn't she?
She went to Delhi for higher studies last year, didn't she?
She speaks good English, doesn't she?
She can help you, can't she?
But she wouldn't, would she?
2023


Page Number: 147
Chapter Title: Sentences

Note: If the verb used in the statement is an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary verb is repeated in the tag question. If a modal (can, could, will, should, etc.) is used in the statement, then the same modal is used in the tag part. If the statement doesn't use an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary 'do/ does/ did is used in the tag question.

D Read the following tag questions.
He hardly watches movie, does he?
He never came back, did he?

Note: If there are words such as seldom, hardly, barely, scarcely, nothing, none, no one, neither, few, little, never in a sentence, it is considered as a negative sentence. Therefore, notice that tag questions are in affirmation.

E Read the following examples.
Nobody likes to be criticized, do they?
Everybody wanted to talk to the celebrity, didn't they?

Note: If everybody, all, somebody, someone, anybody, any one, no one, none is used as a subject, then the subject of the tag question would be 'they'.

F Read the following examples.
Nothing was easy, was it?
Anything will be all right, will it?

Note: If anything, something, everything, nothing is used as a subject, then 'it' would be used as a pronoun.

Read the examples below:
Take a seat, won't you?
Help me, will you?
Close the door, would you?
Let us go out for a walk, shall we?

: No, I didn't. I went with my parents.
: Did you like it?
: Oh, yes, I did. It was magnificent.

Notice that we could answer all the questions in the above conversation with
just yes/no. But in many contexts it wouldn't sound very polite. Hence, a short
answer (Yes, I did. No, I didn't, and so on) is more usual.

Usually we don't use a full sentence to answer a wh-question, but to add
emphasis and, for variation we can sometimes use a full sentence.

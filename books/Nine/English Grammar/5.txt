Section Title: 5/1: Primary auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries

In the last unit we discussed verbs and tenses. In this unit we will focus on modals.

A Read the passage below and the conversation that follows:

Rehana took a secretarial course a few months ago. She **can** write short-hand and **can** type too. But she **cannot** use a word processor. She realizes that to get a good secretarial job, she **must** learn to use a computer. She also has to improve her English which is not very good. This morning she goes to an English Language Centre that a friend has recommended. At the administrative office there she has the following conversation with a member of the official staff:

Admin staff : Good morning! **Can** I help you?
Rehana : Morning. **Could** you please tell me when the next English course starts?
Admin staff: Well, we have different courses like General Communicative English, Business English, and English for nurses and so on. Which one **would** you like to do?
Rehana : The Business English course. **Could** you tell me when the next course starts and what the fee is?
Admin staff : Sure. It's a three-month course and the fee is Taka 5000. **Would** you like to take a brochure - you **can** find details about all the courses that we offer. You **might** like to have a look at them.
Rehana : Thanks a lot.

Notice the words in bold. They are called modal verbs or modal auxiliaries.

Verbs : Modals

Grammar point

There are two kinds of auxiliary verbs in English:
**Primary auxiliaries:** am/is/are/was/were, have/has/had, do/does/did
**Modal auxiliaries:** can/could, may/might, will/would, shall/should, must/ought to/need

Modal auxiliaries are different from Primary auxiliaries in the following ways:
**Past tense forms:** The primary auxiliaries have past tense forms. The modal auxiliaries do not. For example, *must* or *may* do not have a past form. (*may* and *might* can refer to the same time: present or future)
**Third person forms:** The primary auxiliaries have third person forms (he/she+is/has/does). Modal auxiliaries do not change. They have no –s form.
**Infinitives:** The primary auxiliaries are related to an infinitive: to be, to have, or to do. There is no infinitive form for the modal auxiliaries. (We do not say to can, or to might.)

**Note:** *Need* fits into both categories.
It can be used as a **full verb:** *need, needs, needed*, e.g.
*We need sugar.*  *He needs rest.*  *They needed some money.*
It can also be used as a **modal auxiliary verb:**
*We needn’t take a taxi.*  *We needn’t go to the doctor.*

Use
We use modals to express a variety of moods or attitudes towards actions or events in the past, present or future. Modals can be used to express possibility, certainty, ability to do something, requests, permission, obligation, necessity, prohibition, advice, etc.
Look at the following sentences:

Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

Grammar point
Can and could are modal verbs, and are used like auxiliaries before the main verb.
We make the negative by adding not/n't to can/could. Note how we write cannot. There is no break between can and not:
I cannot fly like a bird.
To make questions we say can /could + name/pronoun + main verb:
Can/could you pass me the salt, please? Can you use a computer?

Use
Can/could for ability, and cannot for inability/prohibition:
We use can to express ability: I can sing and I can dance.
In the sentence But I cannot fly like a bird, cannot expresses lack of ability.
The past tense of can as ability is could: Two years ago I could walk for miles, but now I cannot.
We use cannot/can't to express prohibition: You cannot bring mobile phones into the classroom, and you cannot chew gums in my class.

For permission and requests:
We use can/could to give or ask for permission. Can is less formal than could.
Can I borrow your pen? Oh, sure!
Could I use your laptop, please? You could take it to your room, if you like.

Grammar point
Form
May and might are modal verbs and are used, like auxiliary verbs, to express different meanings of the main verb.
In a positive sentence, we use may/might + verb
For negatives, we use may not/might not + verb

Note: May/might are not usually used in a question form to mean possibility.
We can use may in a question to express asking for or giving permission. For example,
May I sit here? Yes, you may. May I see that book? No, you may not.
However, this sounds very formal in everyday situations now, and can/could are used more frequently.
We use may/might to refer to the present or future time:
It may rain this evening.
The shoes might be too small for you.
He may be in his office now.

Use We use may or might to say that something is possible but not certain, now or in future:
He may not be in office now.
You may see him in office tomorrow.
He might offer you the job.

Section Title: 5/4: Will/Won't and Would

We have already discussed the use of Will and Shall to express future facts or events. These are modal auxiliaries, and go before the main verb, and do not change.

A Read the following passage and notice the use of will, won't and would as modal auxiliaries:

a. My family and I will go to attend my cousin's wedding tomorrow at Munshiganj. Father has already made all the arrangements. We will first take a bus to the Sadarghat, and then we will go by a steamer to Munshiganj. We will stay there overnight and will come back the next evening. I'm a little sad that I won't go to school tomorrow and the day after, but I don't want to miss all the fun at the wedding either.

b. : Hello, Rupam!
: Hi, Shahed! How are you?
: I'm good. Listen, we're going on a river cruise tomorrow morning. Would you like to join us?
: Oh, I'd love to. What time would you leave?
: We will all meet at the school ground at 7.00.
: Okay I'll be there by 7.00. Would you please give me a wake - up call at 6.15?
: I will. See you tomorrow then.
2023

Verbs: Modals

Grammar point

Will and won't are used to predict a future event which is seen as certain:
My family and I will go to attend my cousin's wedding tomorrow.
We will meet at the school ground at 7.00.

Note that in conversations we usually use won't in place of will not.
Also we don't generally use will not in negative questions. Instead, we say,
'Won't you come to see me off at the airport?'

We use would for invitations, requests, and for polite conversations:
Would you like to join us for the river cruise? I'd love to.
What would you like to have, tea or coffee?

We usually use the contracted form of would ('d) after words ending in a vowel
sound:
I'd/ we'd/ he'd/ she'd, etc.
But we don't say, 'It'd' (x), instead, we'd say 'It would'.

Activity 1 Fill in the blanks with will or won't or would.
a Jamal has less than 75% attendance in class. He _______ be allowed to sit for the exam. What _______ he do now? I think he _______ keep it a secret from his parents, and _______ even tell his sister whom he tells almost everything.

library?

d : Ah...I'm exhausted! ________ you please give me a glass of water?
: Sure. ________ you like to have something to eat?

please?
: Not at all.
: Thanks, dear.

e : I hope the function starts on time. It's already ten minutes to
seven now.

5/5: Must, Must not/ Mustn't, Need

A Read the following texts:

a : He ate a dozen eggs at a time! He must be crazy!

b : You must be joking! I don't believe you.

My mark-sheet shows that I've failed in English! There must be
some mistake. English has always been my strong subject. It
simply can't be!

c The teacher says to her students, "You must submit your essays
tomorrow. I won't accept any after that. And you must not copy
from any book or from anyone else's writing.

d Hello, everybody! Here's an announcement for tomorrow's
workshop. All the delegates must finish registration by 9 o'clock.
The delegates must wear their badges while attending the
sessions. The volunteers mustn't leave the venue before the
workshop is over at 6 p.m. The Information desk will remain
open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. for all kinds of assistance to the
participants, delegates and the guests.

e When you go for an interview you need to make a good
impression as soon as you enter the room. You need to give the
impression of being polite and at the same time of being
confident and pleasant. Here are just a few things you should
remember:

You mustn't move about in your chair, you must sit still and
relax;


Page Number: 88
Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

You needn't wear new or fashionable clothes, but you must
wear clean and neat clothes;
You need to speak loudly and clearly, but mustn't interrupt
when they are speaking.

Use
We can use must and can't to assert something that we infer or conclude to be
the most logical possibility of a situation or an event. For example,
He must be crazy to eat a dozen eggs at a time.
Or, as the examinee is confident that he just cannot fail in English since it is
his strong subject, he uses 'can't' to express the most logical possibility of
the situation:
It simply can't be.
There must be some mistake in the mark-sheet.
We use must to express obligation and mustn't to express prohibition or
something that is not allowed
You must submit your essays tomorrow. (obligation)
Delegates must finish registration... (obligation)
You must not copy from any book or anyone else's writing. (prohibition)
Volunteers mustn't leave before ...... (prohibition)
You must wear clean and neat clothes.... (obligation)
You mustn't move about in your chair.... (not allowed)
You mustn't interrupt when they are speaking.... (not allowed)
We use need to talk about something that is necessary:

f : Do you know when Tom is arriving?

: Well, he **shouldn't** be late. The train has left on time, so he
**should** be here at 4.00 as scheduled.

Grammar point
Should and ought to are modal verbs and go before the main verb. We can use
them for the present:
2023


Page 93
Verbs : Modals

We should find a place to eat now.

Or for the future:
He should/ought to go to a doctor.

We make the negative by adding not /n't :
If you want to lose weight, you shouldn't eat so much chocolate.
And you ought not to eat junk or oily food.

We don't usually use ought to in questions. We make questions with
should + subject + verb

e.g. Has Zaman sent the reports? I need them today.
I don't think he has. Should I send him a mail or should I call
him?

Or, Shouldn't he consult a doctor before that?

Use

We often use should or ought to when we are giving advice:
You've had that cough for quite some time. You should/ought to see a
doctor.

We use should or ought to for expressing an opinion:
It's a good book. You should/ought to read it. (I think)

We often use should to talk about things we expect to happen in the future:
Tom shouldn't be late. The train has left the station on time. He should be here
at 4.00 as scheduled.

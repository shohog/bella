01 The Noun 1/1: Kinds of Nouns

A Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:

Shakespeare was born in 1564 at
Stratford-upon-Avon in England.
He was a poet, playwright and actor.
He is widely regarded as one of the
greatest writer in English and the
most prominent dramatist of
the world. He enjoys enormous
popularity even in the modern
age for his plays and poems.

These are all nouns. The noun is a naming word. It may name a person, place
or thing. There is a bewildering variety of things in the world. So there is a
bewildering number of nouns in a language.
Look back at the nouns in the passage above and think what they name.

There are five kinds of nouns in English. They are:
1. Proper nouns
2. Common nouns
3. Collective nouns
4. Material nouns
5. Abstract nouns

Activity 1 Notice the underlined words in the following passage and say what they refer to:

Rajshahi is a divisional city in Bangladesh. It is in the western part of the country. It stands on the river Padma. My friend Alamgir lives in this city. He is a professor of History. I often visit him and discuss many things with him. He speaks good English.

These are all proper nouns. A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place or thing. For example, "Rajshahi" is the name of a particular city and "History" is the name of a particular subject. Think of the other proper nouns in the passage. A proper noun usually begins with a capital letter. A proper noun is usually singular but some proper nouns are plural in form.

For example:
The Maldives is an island country.
Have you ever been to the Philippines?
The United Nations has a big responsibility.

Note: Although these nouns are plural in form, they take a singular verb with them.

Activity 2 Notice the underlined words in the following passage:

Nasima is a beautiful girl. She is a bright student too. She reads in a local
college. She has many friends. She discusses her lessons with them. She
attends classes regularly. Every teacher is fond of her.

These are common nouns. A common noun refers to every person, place or
thing of the same class or kind. It does not refer to anything in particular. For
example, the noun 'girl' may mean any girl in the world. A common noun can
be both singular and plural. For example:

London is a big city.

There are many big cities in the world.

Note: A proper noun can be used as a common noun. Look at the following
examples:

He is called the Shakespeare (= the greatest dramatist) of Bangladesh.
There are two Raghibs in this class.

B Look at the underlined nouns in the following passage:

Salam comes of a big family. He has three brothers. His elder brother is a
member of Parliament. His younger brother has recently joined the army. His
other brother is a cricketer who plays for the national team. Salam himself is a
Civil Servant who works for the government.

These are collective nouns. A collective noun is the name of a collection or
group of people or things taken together. For example, an army is a group of
soldiers and a team is a group of players. Think of the other nouns in the
passage as a group of persons spoken of as one whole. A collective noun can
take both singular and plural verbs after it. For example:

The government has/have decided on a new pay scale.

The committee was/were in favour of my proposal.

C Read the following passage and notice the underlined nouns:

Mrs. Rahman is now visiting a jeweller. She will buy some gold and silver to make some jewellery. Next, she will also go to a grocery shop. She needs to buy sugar, tea, milk and oil.

These are material nouns. A material noun names a thing that has weight but cannot be counted. It is a kind of mass noun which is considered uncountable. It refers to any material or substance. The substance may be solid, liquid or gaseous. “Oxygen” is also a material noun.

D Look at the underlined nouns in the following passage:

Mr. Haque was a freedom fighter. He is known for his bravery. He is working for a private company now. Everybody loves him for his honesty and sincerity. He is an admirer of freedom and justice.

These are abstract nouns. An abstract noun is the name of a quality, state or concept. It has no material form, shape or size.

Activity 3 Think of some other abstract nouns and make a sentence with each of them.

Activity 4 Identify the nouns in the following passage, and say whether they are Proper, Common, Collective, Material or Abstract nouns.

Hasan is a rich farmer who lives in a village in the district of Sirajganj. He has a lot of cultivable land. He grows rice, wheat and other crops. He has a herd of cattle and other domestic animals. They provide him with milk and meat. Hasan is a kind man. He has love and sympathy for the poor class of people.

Section Title: 1/2: Number

A Read the following two passages and notice the forms of the underlined nouns:

(i) Mr. Aslam is a teacher. His wife is a banker. They have only one child. Theirs is a small family. They live a happy life.

(ii) Mr. and Mrs. Hasan are teachers. They have two children. Both of them are students. All the four members of this family are fond of books.

In the first passage each of the underlined nouns denotes only one person or thing. On the other hand, each underlined noun in the second passage denotes more than one person or thing.

This is related to number. A noun that denotes one person or thing is said to have a singular form. For example, the nouns in the first passage (teacher, banker, child, family and life) are all singular in form. On the contrary, a noun that denotes more than one person or thing is said to have a plural form. For example, all the nouns in the second passage (teachers, children, students, members and books) are plural in form.

Number is a grammatical distinction which tells whether a noun (also a pronoun, verb or determiner) is singular or plural. There are two numbers in English — the Singular and the Plural.

B Plurals are usually formed by adding s, es or ies to the singular form. Look at the following examples.
(i) Singular + s = plural
boy boys
girl girls
dog dogs
page pages
monkey monkeys
Note: Most nouns are made plural by adding an s to the singular form.
(ii) Singular + es = plural
bus buses
kiss kisses
dish dishes
watch watches
box boxes
Note: Plurals are formed by adding es when the singular form ends in s, ss, sh, ch and x.
(iii) Singular + ies = plural
baby babies
lady ladies
story stories
duty duties
fly flies
Note: Singular nouns ending in a consonant + y form their plurals by dropping y and adding ies.

C Plural forms of nouns can also be made in other ways. Notice the following examples:
(i) Singular nouns ending in f/fe form their plurals by dropping f/fe and adding ves:
calf calves

D Number is applicable not only for nouns but also for pronouns, verbs and determiners. Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:

[Image of two people in a rickshaw and one person riding a bicycle]

Karim is a student of class nine. He is my friend. We go to school together by rickshaw. We always share our rickshaw fare. In his free time he loves to play badminton while I love to watch movies.

In this passage 'he' and 'we' are pronouns; 'reads', 'is', 'go' and 'share' are verbs, and 'my' and 'our' are determiners. You can easily guess which of these words are singular and which are plural. Remember, whether a verb is singular or plural is determined by its subject. A singular subject takes a singular verb and a plural subject takes a plural verb.

Activity 1 Now fill in the gaps in the following sentences:

We have a pet that _______ in our house. We _______ all very fond of it. My mother _______ care of it. It _______ to eat fish and milk. It _______ us by killing _______.

Section Title: 1/4: Possessives and Appositives

A Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:

[Image of a school building]

This is Salma's school. This is a girls' school. Her elder sister's husband is the founder of this school. It is one of the best schools in Rajshahi. Will you go to the Headmistress's chamber and talk to her about your daughter's admission?

These are all possessive forms of nouns. The possessive case is a grammatical phenomenon which indicates relationship or ownership.

Note: The possessive case is formed in mainly two ways:

(i) When the noun is singular, its possessive form will be noun + 's:

For example:

Della's hair is very long.

This is Nazma's bag.

However, in some possessives the letter s is omitted in order to avoid a hissing sound.

For example:

I have done it for conscience' sake.

You should sacrifice it for goodness' sake.

Chapter Title: English Grammar and Composition

(ii) When the noun is plural and ends in s, the possessive case is formed by
adding only an apostrophe and no s after it.
For example:
She reads in a girls’ school.
Horses’ tails are short.
But other plurals take (apostrophe + s) in their possessive forms:
For example:
These are children’s books.
This is a women’s club.

Activity 1 Correct the following sentences using the possessive forms of
the nouns in bold:
(i) Nazrul father is seriously ill. He is now at death door. His recovery
at this stage completely depends on Fortune favour.
(ii) Mr. Haque is ill. He is on three days casual leave. In case of
emergency, he can apply for one month medical leave.
(iii) Yesterday I visited Mr. Islam and Mr. Kabir families. But I could
not visit Mr. Rahim and Mrs. Rahim family.

B Here are some more examples of the possessive forms of nouns:
Bangladesh’s foreign policy is admirable.
We must obey Nature’s laws.
He was at his wit’s end.
I ate to my heart’s content.
Everything is at my fingers’ ends.
He has lost a pound’s weight.
Everything depends on heaven’s will.
His house is only at a stone’s throw from mine.
It is not your money’s worth.
It is a day’s journey from here to Dhaka.

C Nouns in Apposition :

Apposition means “placing near”. It is a grammatical arrangement in which two words referring to the same person or thing are placed side by side in a sentence.

Read the following passage and notice the underlined words.

Mr. Rahman, our Headmaster, is a very nice man. My friend, Nazrul and I saw him yesterday. He discussed many things with both of us. He also talked about his childhood days. We also met his wife, Mrs Salma Begum. She is our English teacher. We like both of them.

In the first sentence, Rahman and Headmaster refer to the same person. The noun “Headmaster” follows the noun “Rahman” simply to mean which Rahman is referred to. Here the second noun “Headmaster” is said to be in apposition to the first noun “Rahman”.

Similar is the case with “Nazrul” in the second sentence. It is in apposition to the first noun “friend”. The second noun in such a situation is also called an appositive.

Activity 2 Find out the other appositive in the passage:

Activity 3 Read the following passage and identify the appositives in it:

We, the students of class nine, are going to publish a magazine. Kazal, the first boy of our class, will be the chief editor of the magazine. Mr. Rafiq, our class teacher, is our chief adviser. We believe that many students will write for the magazine.

Core Concept: Definition of Simple Simultaneous Equations
Bengali Explanation: x+y = 5 একটি সমীকরণ। এখানে, x ও y দুইটি অজানা রাশি বা চলক। এই চলক দুইটি একঘাতবিশিষ্ট। এরূপ সমীকরণ সরল সমীকরণ। এখানে, যে সংখ্যাদ্বয়ের যোগফল 5 সেই সংখ্যা দ্বারাই সমীকরণটি সিদ্ধ হবে। যেমন, x = 4, y = 1; বা, x = 3, y = 2; বা, x = 2, y = 3; বা, x = 1, y = 4, ইত্যাদি, এরূপ অসংখ্য সংখ্যাযুগল দ্বারা সমীকরণটি সিদ্ধ হবে। আবার, x - y = 3 এই সমীকরণটি বিবেচনা করলে দেখতে পাই, সমীকরণটি x = 4, y = 1 বা x = 5, y = 2 বা x = 6, y = 3 বা x = 7, y = 4 বা x = 8, y = 5 বা x = 2, y=-1 বা x = 1, y = -2, x = 0, y = -3... ইত্যাদি অসংখ্য সংখ্যাযুগল দ্বারা সিদ্ধ হয়। এখানে, x + y = 5 এবং x - y = 3 সমীকরণ দুইটি একত্রে বিবেচনা করলে উভয় সমীকরণ হতে প্রাপ্ত সংখ্যাযুগলের মধ্যে x = 4, y = 1 দ্বারা উভয় সমীকরণ যুগপৎ সিদ্ধ হয়। চলকের মান দ্বারা একাধিক সমীকরণ সিদ্ধ হলে, সমীকরণসমূহকে একত্রে সহসমীকরণ বলা হয় এবং চলক একঘাত বিশিষ্ট হলে সহসমীকরণকে সরল সহসমীকরণ বলে।
English Translation: x + y = 5 is an equation. Here, x and y are two unknown quantities or variables. These variables are of the first degree. Such an equation is a simple equation. Here, the equation will be satisfied by any pair of numbers whose sum is 5. For example, x = 4, y = 1; or x = 3, y = 2; or x = 2, y = 3; or x = 1, y = 4, etc. There are infinitely many such pairs of numbers that satisfy the equation. Again, if we consider the equation x - y = 3, we see that the equation is satisfied by x = 4, y = 1 or x = 5, y = 2 or x = 6, y = 3 or x = 7, y = 4 or x = 8, y = 5 or x = 2, y = -1 or x = 1, y = -2, x = 0, y = -3... etc. There are infinitely many such pairs of numbers that satisfy the equation. Here, if we consider the two equations x + y = 5 and x - y = 3 together, we find that the pair x = 4, y = 1 satisfies both equations simultaneously. If multiple equations are satisfied by the values of the variables, the equations are called simultaneous equations. If the variables are of the first degree, the simultaneous equations are called simple simultaneous equations.
Mathematical Notation:
Equation 1: x + y = 5
Equation 2: x - y = 3

- English Translation: Example 3. 10 years ago, the ratio of the ages of a father and his son was 4:1. 10 years later, the ratio of their ages will be 2:1. Find the present ages of the father and the son.
- Given Information: Ratio of ages 10 years ago = 4:1, Ratio of ages 10 years later = 2:1
- Unknown Elements: Present age of father (x), Present age of son (y)

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Two ratios of ages at different times.
   - Relevant formula selection: Setting up equations based on the given ratios.
   - Strategy planning: Form two equations and solve them simultaneously.

2. Solution Steps
   - Step-by-step breakdown:
     - Let the present age of the father be x years and the present age of the son be y years.
     - 10 years ago, the ages were (x-10) and (y-10). The ratio is (x-10)/(y-10) = 4/1. This simplifies to x - 4y = -30 (Equation 1).
     - 10 years later, the ages will be (x+10) and (y+10). The ratio is (x+10)/(y+10) = 2/1. This simplifies to x - 2y = 10 (Equation 2).
     - Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: (x - 4y) - (x - 2y) = -30 - 10, which gives -2y = -40, so y = 20.
     - Substitute y=20 in equation 2: x - 2(20) = 10, which gives x = 50.
   - Mathematical reasoning: Using the given ratios to form linear equations and solving them.

Core Concept: Forming and solving simultaneous equations from a word problem involving a two-digit number.
Bengali Explanation: উদাহরণ ৪। দুই অঙ্কবিশিষ্ট কোনো সংখ্যার অঙ্কদ্বয়ের সমষ্টির সাথে 7 যোগ করলে যোগফল দশক স্থানীয় অঙ্কটির তিনগুণ হয়। কিন্তু সংখ্যাটি থেকে 18 বাদ দিলে অঙ্কদ্বয় স্থান পরিবর্তন করে। সংখ্যাটি নির্ণয় কর। সমাধান: মনে করি, দুই অঙ্কবিশিষ্ট সংখ্যাটির একক স্থানীয় অঙ্ক x এবং দশক স্থানীয় অঙ্ক y। সংখ্যাটি = x+10y. ১ম শর্তানুসারে, x + y +7 = 3y, বা, x-2y = -7. ২য় শর্তানুসারে, x+10y-18=y+10x, বা, y-x=2. (1) ও (2) নং যোগ করে পাই, -y = -5, y=5. y-এর মান (1) নং-এ বসিয়ে পাই, x=3. নির্ণেয় সংখ্যাটি = 3+10×5=53.
English Translation: Example 4: If 7 is added to the sum of the digits of a two-digit number, the result is three times the digit in the tens place. If 18 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange their places. Find the number. Solution: Let the digit in the units place be x and the digit in the tens place be y. The number is x+10y. According to the first condition, x + y +7 = 3y, which simplifies to x-2y = -7. According to the second condition, x+10y-18=y+10x, which simplifies to y-x=2. Adding equations (1) and (2), we get -y=-5, so y=5. Substituting y=5 in equation (1), we get x=3. The required number is 3+10*5=53.
Mathematical Notation:
```
Number = x + 10y
x + y + 7 = 3y
x - 2y = -7  (1)
x + 10y - 18 = y + 10x
9y - 9x = 18
y - x = 2 (2)
-y = -5
y = 5
x - 2(5) = -7
x = 3
Number = 3 + 10(5) = 53

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Definition of a Set
Bengali Explanation: বাস্তব বা চিন্তাজগতের সু-সংজ্ঞায়িত বস্তুর সমাবেশ বা সংগ্রহকে সেট বলে। ইংরেজি বর্ণমালার প্রথম পাঁচটি বর্ণ, এশিয়া মহাদেশের দেশসমূহ, স্বাভাবিক সংখ্যা ইত্যাদির সেট সু-সংজ্ঞায়িত সেটের উদাহরণ। কোন বস্তু বিবেচনাধীন সেটের অন্তর্ভুক্ত আর কোনটি নয় তা সুনির্দিষ্টভাবে নির্ধারিত হতে হবে। সেটের বস্তুর কোনো পুনরাবৃত্তি ও ক্রম নেই।
English Translation: A set is a well-defined collection or group of objects from the real world or our thoughts. Examples of well-defined sets include the first five letters of the English alphabet, the countries of Asia, and the set of natural numbers. It must be clearly determined whether an object belongs to the set or not. There is no repetition or order of objects in a set.
Mathematical Notation: N/A
Visual Support: N/A
Real-World Connection: Examples like sets of dishes (tea set, dinner set), furniture (sofa set), and books are given to relate to everyday experiences.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Elements of a Set
Bengali Explanation: সেটের প্রত্যেক বস্তুকে সেটের উপাদান (element) বলা হয়। সেটকে সাধারণত ইংরেজি বর্ণমালার বড় হাতের অক্ষর A, B, C,..., X, Y, Z দ্বারা এবং উপাদানকে ছোট হাতের অক্ষর a, b, c,...,x, y, z দ্বারা প্রকাশ করা হয়।
English Translation: Each object in a set is called an element. Sets are usually represented by uppercase letters of the English alphabet (A, B, C,..., X, Y, Z), and elements are represented by lowercase letters (a, b, c,...,x, y, z).
Mathematical Notation: N/A

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Set Representation
Bengali Explanation: সেটের উপাদানগুলোকে {} এই প্রতীকের মধ্যে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করে সেট হিসেবে ব্যবহার করা হয়। যেমন: a,b,c-এর সেট {a,b,c}; তিস্তা, মেঘনা, যমুনা ও ব্রহ্মপুত্র নদ-নদীর সেট {তিস্তা, মেঘনা, যমুনা, ব্রহ্মপুত্র}, প্রথম দুইটি জোড় স্বাভাবিক সংখ্যার সেট {2,4}; 6 এর গুণনীয়কসমূহের সেট {1, 2, 3, 6} ইত্যাদি।
English Translation: The elements of a set are enclosed within the curly braces {} to represent the set. For example, the set of a, b, and c is {a, b, c}; the set of rivers Tista, Meghna, Jamuna, and Brahmaputra is {Tista, Meghna, Jamuna, Brahmaputra}; the set of the first two even natural numbers is {2, 4}; and the set of factors of 6 is {1, 2, 3, 6}.
Mathematical Notation: {a, b, c}, {2, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 6}

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Set Membership Notation
Bengali Explanation: মনে করি, সেট A এর একটি উপাদান x। একে গাণিতিকভাবে x ∈ A প্রতীক দ্বারা প্রকাশ করা হয়। x ∈ A কে পড়তে হয়, x, A সেটের উপাদান (x belongs to A)। যেমন, B = {m, n} হলে, m∈ B এবং n∈ B.
English Translation: Let x be an element of set A. This is mathematically represented as x ∈ A. x ∈ A is read as "x is an element of A" or "x belongs to A". For example, if B = {m, n}, then m ∈ B and n ∈ B.
Mathematical Notation: x ∈ A

Bengali Explanation: উদাহরণ ৬। U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} এবং A = {2, 4, 6} হলে A° নির্ণয় কর। সমাধান: দেওয়া আছে, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} এবং A = {2, 4, 6} ∴ A° = A এর পূরক সেট = A এর বহির্ভূত উপাদানসমূহের সেট = {1, 3, 5} নির্ণেয় সেট A° = {1, 3, 5}
English Translation: Example 6. If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and A = {2, 4, 6}, then find Aᶜ. Solution: Given, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and A = {2, 4, 6}. Therefore, Aᶜ = the complement of A = the set of elements not in A = {1, 3, 5}. The required set Aᶜ = {1, 3, 5}.
Mathematical Notation: Given U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and A = {2, 4, 6}, then Aᶜ = {1, 3, 5}.
Visual Support: A rectangle labeled U with a circle labeled A inside. The numbers 1, 3, and 5 are outside the circle, and 2, 4, and 6 are inside the circle.
Real-World Connection: This example shows how to calculate the complement of a set given a universal set.

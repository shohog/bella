CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Example of Data
Bengali Explanation: ধরা যাক, ৫০ নম্বরের মধ্যে অনুষ্ঠিত কোনো প্রতিযোগিতামূলক পরীক্ষায় অংশগ্রহণকারী ২০ জন প্রার্থীর গণিতের প্রাপ্ত নম্বর হলো ২৫, ৪৫, ৪০, ২০, ৩৫, ৩০, ৩৫, ৩০, ৪০, ৪১, ৪৬, ২০, ২৫, ৩০, ৪৫,৪২, ৪৫, ৪৭, ৫০, ৩০। এখানে, গণিতে প্রাপ্ত সংখ্যা-নির্দেশিত নম্বরসমূহ একটি পরিসংখ্যান। আর নম্বরগুলো হলো এ পরিসংখ্যানের উপাত্ত।
English Translation: Suppose, the math scores of 20 students participating in a competition out of 50 marks are 25, 45, 40, 20, 35, 30, 35, 30, 40, 41, 46, 20, 25, 30, 45, 42, 45, 47, 50, 30. Here, the numbers representing the math scores are a statistic. And the numbers themselves are the data of this statistic.
Mathematical Notation: None in this section.
Visual Support: None in this section.
Real-World Connection: This is a typical example of test scores, which are a common type of data.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Primary and Secondary Data
Bengali Explanation: এ উপাত্তগুলো সহজে সরাসরি উৎস থেকে সংগ্রহ করা যায়। সরাসরি উৎস থেকে সংগৃহীত উপাত্তের নির্ভরযোগ্যতা অনেক বেশি। সরাসরি উৎস থেকে সংগৃহীত হয় এমন উপাত্ত হলো প্রাথমিক উপাত্ত। মাধ্যমিক উপাত্ত পরোক্ষ উৎস থেকে সংগৃহীত হয় বিধায় এর নির্ভরযোগ্যতা অনেক কম।
English Translation: These data can be easily collected directly from the source. The reliability of data collected directly from the source is very high. Data collected directly from the source is called primary data. Secondary data is collected from indirect sources, and therefore its reliability is much lower.
Mathematical Notation: None in this section.
Visual Support: None in this section.
Real-World Connection: Primary data is like conducting a survey yourself, while secondary data is like using data from a published report.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Ungrouped and Grouped Data
Bengali Explanation: উপরে বর্ণিত উপাত্তের নম্বরগুলো এলোমেলোভাবে আছে। নম্বরগুলো মানের কোনো ক্রমে সাজানো নেই। এ ধরনের উপাত্ত হলো অবিন্যস্ত উপাত্ত। এ উপাত্তের নম্বরগুলো মানের যেকোনো ক্রমে সাজালে হবে বিন্যস্ত উপাত্ত। নম্বরগুলো মানের ঊর্ধ্বক্রমে সাজালে হয় ২০, ২০, ২৫, ২৫, ৩০, ৩০, ৩০, ৩০, ৩৫, ৩৫, ৪০, ৪০, ৪১, ৪২, ৪৫, ৪৫, ৪৫, ৪৬, ৪৭, ৫০ যা একটি বিন্যস্ত উপাত্ত। অবিন্যস্ত উপাত্ত এভাবে বিন্যস্ত করা বেশ জটিল এবং ভুল হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা থেকে যায়। শ্রেণিবিন্যাসের মাধ্যমে অবিন্যস্ত উপাত্তসমূহ অতিসহজে বিন্যস্ত উপাত্তে রূপান্তর করা যায় এবং গণসংখ্যা সারণির সাহায্যে উপস্থাপন করা হয়।
English Translation: The numbers in the data mentioned above are in a random order. The numbers are not arranged in any order of value. This type of data is called ungrouped data. If the numbers in this data are arranged in any order of value, it becomes grouped data. Arranging the numbers in ascending order gives 20, 20, 25, 25, 30, 30, 30, 30, 35, 35, 40, 40, 41, 42, 45, 45, 45, 46, 47, 50, which is grouped data. Arranging ungrouped data in this way is quite complex and there is a possibility of making mistakes. Through classification, ungrouped data can be easily converted into grouped data and presented using a frequency table.
Mathematical Notation: None in this section.
Visual Support: None in this section.
Real-World Connection: Ungrouped data is like a list of random numbers, while grouped data is like a sorted list.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Class Width
Bengali Explanation: শ্রেণিব্যাপ্তি: যেকোনো অনুসন্ধানলব্ধ উপাত্তের পরিসর নির্ধারণের পর প্রয়োজন হয় শ্রেণিব্যাপ্তি নির্ধারণ। উপাত্তগুলোকে সুবিধাজনক ব্যবধান নিয়ে কতকগুলো শ্রেণিতে ভাগ করা হয়। উপাত্তের সংখ্যার উপর ভিত্তি করে এগুলো সাধারণত শ্রেণিতে ভাগ করা হয়। শ্রেণিতে ভাগ করার নির্ধারিত কোনো নিয়ম নেই। তবে সচরাচর প্রত্যেক শ্রেণিব্যবধান সর্বনিম্ন ৫ ও সর্বোচ্চ ১৫-এর মধ্যে সীমাবদ্ধ রাখা হয়। সুতরাং প্রত্যেক শ্রেণির একটি সর্বোচ্চ ও সর্বনিম্ন মান থাকে। যেকোনো শ্রেণির সর্বনিম্ন মানকে এর নিম্নসীমা এবং সর্বোচ্চ মানকে এর ঊর্ধ্বসীমা বলা হয়। আর যেকোনো শ্রেণির ঊর্ধ্বসীমা ও নিম্নসীমার ব্যবধান হলো সেই শ্রেণির শ্রেণিব্যাপ্তি। উদাহরণস্বরূপ, মনে করি, ১০-২০ হলো একটি শ্রেণি, এর সর্বনিম্ন মান ১০ ও সর্বোচ্চ মান ২০ এবং (২০-১০) = ১০ শ্রেণি ব্যাপ্তি হবে। ১০+১=১১। শ্রেণি ব্যাপ্তি সবসময় সমান রাখা শ্রেয়।
English Translation: Class width: After determining the range of any data, it is necessary to determine the class width. The data is divided into several classes with a convenient interval. These are usually divided into classes based on the number of data. There is no fixed rule for dividing into classes. However, usually, each class interval is kept between a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15. Therefore, each class has a maximum and a minimum value. The minimum value of any class is called its lower limit and the maximum value is called its upper limit. And the difference between the upper and lower limits of any class is the class width of that class. For example, suppose 10-20 is a class, its minimum value is 10 and the maximum value is 20 and (20-10) = 10 will be the class width. 10+1=11. It is preferable to keep the class width always equal.
Mathematical Notation: Class Width = Upper Limit - Lower Limit

Real-World Connection: Grouping data into manageable categories.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Number of Classes
Bengali Explanation: শ্রেণিসংখ্যা: শ্রেণিসংখ্যা হচ্ছে পরিসরকে যতগুলো শ্রেণিতে ভাগ করা হয় এর সংখ্যা।

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Tally Marks
Bengali Explanation: ট্যালি চিহ্ন: উপাত্তের সংখ্যাসূচক তথ্যরাশির মান কোনো না কোনো শ্রেণিতে পড়ে। শ্রেণির বিপরীতে সাংখ্যিক মানের জন্য ট্যালি 'IN' চিহ্ন দিতে হয়। কোনো শ্রেণিতে পাঁচটি ট্যালি চিহ্ন দিতে হলে চারটি দেওয়ার পর পঞ্চমটি আড়াআড়িভাবে দিতে হয়।
English Translation: Tally marks: The numerical values of the data fall into one class or another. Tally 'IN' marks are given for numerical values against the class. If five tally marks are to be given in a class, the fifth one is given diagonally after giving four.
Mathematical Notation: N/A
Visual Support: N/A
Real-World Connection: Manually counting data occurrences.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Frequency
Bengali Explanation: গণসংখ্যা: শ্রেণিসমূহের মধ্যে সংখ্যাসূচক তথ্যরাশির মানগুলো ট্যালি চিহ্ন দিয়ে প্রকাশ করা হয় এবং এর মাধ্যমে গণসংখ্যা বা ঘটনসংখ্যা নির্ধারণ করা হয়। যে শ্রেণিতে যতগুলো ট্যালি চিহ্ন পড়বে তত হবে ঐ শ্রেণির গণসংখ্যা বা ঘটনসংখ্যা, যা ট্যালি চিহ্নের বিপরীতে গণসংখ্যা কলামে লেখা হয়।
English Translation: Frequency: The numerical values of the data within the classes are represented by tally marks, and the frequency or number of occurrences is determined through this. The number of tally marks in a class is the frequency or number of occurrences of that class, which is written in the frequency column opposite the tally marks.

Core Concept: Short-cut method for calculating arithmetic mean of ungrouped data
Bengali Explanation: অবিন্যস্ত উপাত্তের গাণিতিক গড় নির্ণয় (সংক্ষিপ্ত পদ্ধতি): উপাত্তের সংখ্যা যদি বেশি হয় তবে আগের পদ্ধতিতে গড় নির্ণয় করা বেশ জটিল হয় এবং বেশি সংখ্যক উপাত্তের সংখ্যাসূচক মানের সমষ্টি নির্ণয় করতে ভুল হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা থাকে। এক্ষেত্রে সংক্ষিপ্ত পদ্ধতি ব্যবহার করা বেশ সুবিধাজনক। সংক্ষিপ্ত পদ্ধতিতে উপাত্তসমূহের কেন্দ্রীয় প্রবণতা ভালোভাবে পর্যবেক্ষণ করে এদের সম্ভাব্য গড় অনুমান করা হয়। উপরের উদাহরণে প্রদত্ত উপাত্তের কেন্দ্রীয় প্রবণতা ভালোভাবে লক্ষ করলে বোঝা যায় যে, গাণিতিক গড় ৩০ থেকে ৪৬ এর মধ্যে একটি সংখ্যা। মনে করি, গাণিতিক গড় ৩০। এখন প্রত্যেক সংখ্যা থেকে অনুমিত গড় ৩০ বিয়োগ করে বিয়োগফল নির্ণয় করতে হবে। সংখ্যাটি ৩০ থেকে বড় হলে বিয়োগফল ধনাত্মক এবং ছোট হলে বিয়োগফল ঋণাত্মক হবে। এরপরে সকল বিয়োগফলের বীজগাণিতিক সমষ্টি নির্ণয় করতে হয়। পরপর দুইটি বিয়োগফল যোগ করে ক্রমযোজিত সমষ্টি নির্ণয়ের মাধ্যমে সকল বিয়োগফলের সমষ্টি অতি সহজে নির্ণয় করা যায়। অর্থাৎ, বিয়োগফলের গণসংখ্যা ক্রমযোজিত গণসংখ্যার সমান হবে। উপরের উদাহরণে ব্যবহৃত উপাত্তের গাণিতিক গড় কীভাবে সংক্ষিপ্ত পদ্ধতিতে করা হয় তা নিচের সারণিতে উপস্থাপন করা হলো। মনে করি, উপাত্তসমূহ xᵢ (i=1,2,..., n) এর অনুমিত গড় a ( = ৩০)।
English Translation: Short-cut method for calculating arithmetic mean of ungrouped data: If the number of data points is large, calculating the mean using the previous method becomes complex and there is a chance of making mistakes while summing the numerical values of a large number of data points. In this case, the short-cut method is very convenient. In the short-cut method, the central tendency of the data is observed carefully and a possible mean is estimated. In the above example, if we observe the central tendency of the given data, it can be seen that the arithmetic mean is a number between 30 and 46. Let's assume the arithmetic mean is 30. Now, we need to subtract the assumed mean 30 from each number to find the deviations. If the number is greater than 30, the deviation will be positive, and if it is less than 30, the deviation will be negative. After that, the algebraic sum of all the deviations is calculated. By adding two consecutive deviations, the cumulative sum can be found, which makes it easier to find the sum of all deviations. That is, the sum of the deviations is equal to the cumulative sum of the frequencies. The following table shows how to calculate the arithmetic mean of the data used in the above example using the short-cut method. Let the data be xᵢ (i=1,2,..., n) and the assumed mean be a (=30).

English Translation: We learned about the median of data in statistics in class 7. Let's consider some numbers: 5, 3, 4, 8, 6, 7, 9, 11, 10. Arranging these numbers in ascending order, we get 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Dividing the ordered numbers into two equal parts, we get 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Here, we see that 7 divides the numbers into two equal parts and is in the middle. So, the middle term is the 5th term. The value of this 5th term or the middle term is 7. Therefore, the median of the numbers is 7. Here, the given data or numbers are odd in number. What if the numbers are even in number, like 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22?

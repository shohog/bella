English Translation: The Greek philosopher Pythagoras of the 6th century BC identified a special property of right-angled triangles. This property of right-angled triangles is known as the Pythagorean property. It is said that the use of this property of right-angled triangles existed in the Egyptian and Babylonian eras before the birth of Pythagoras. In this chapter, we will discuss this property of right-angled triangles. The sides of a right-angled triangle are known by special names. The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse, and the two sides adjacent to the right angle are the base and the height, respectively. In this chapter, we will discuss the relationship between the lengths of these three sides.
Mathematical Notation:  The text introduces the concept but does not yet present the formal equation.
Visual Support: A right-angled triangle labeled ABC with the right angle at C. The sides are labeled a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse.
Real-World Connection: The text mentions the historical use of this property in ancient Egypt and Babylon, suggesting its practical applications in construction and surveying.

English Translation: Consider a right-angled triangle ABC where ∠B = 90°. The hypotenuse AC = b, AB = c and BC = a. We need to prove that AC² = AB² + BC², which means b² = c² + a².
Mathematical Notation: b² = c² + a²
Visual Support: A right-angled triangle ABC with sides labeled a, b, and c, and an extended figure with additional triangles and a trapezium.

Problem Statement:
- Bengali Version: প্রমাণ কর যে, একটি সমকোণী ত্রিভুজের অতিভুজের বর্গ তার অন্য দুই বাহুর বর্গের সমষ্টির সমান।
- English Translation: Prove that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
- Given Information: A right-angled triangle ABC with ∠B = 90°, AC = b, AB = c, and BC = a.
- Unknown Elements: To prove b² = c² + a².

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Right-angled triangle, sides a, b, c.
   - Relevant formula selection: Area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height), area of a trapezium (1/2 * sum of parallel sides * distance between them).
   - Strategy planning: Construct additional triangles and a trapezium, then equate the area of the trapezium to the sum of the areas of the triangles.

2. Solution Steps
   - Step 1: Extend BC to D such that CD = AB = c. Draw DE perpendicular to BD such that DE = BC = a. Join C, E and A, E.
   - Step 2: Prove that ∆ABC ≅ ∆CDE using the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence rule. This implies AC = CE = b and ∠BAC = ∠ECD.
   - Step 3: Since AB ⊥ BD and ED ⊥ BD, AB || ED. Therefore, ABDE is a trapezium.
   - Step 4: Show that ∠ACE is a right angle because ∠ACB + ∠BAC = ∠ACB + ∠ECD = 90°. Hence, ∆ACE is a right-angled triangle.
   - Step 5: Calculate the area of trapezium ABDE in two ways:
      - Area of trapezium ABDE = 1/2 * (AB + DE) * BD = 1/2 * (c + a) * (a + c)
      - Area of trapezium ABDE = Area of ∆ABC + Area of ∆CDE + Area of ∆ACE = 1/2 * ac + 1/2 * ac + 1/2 * b²
   - Step 6: Equate the two expressions for the area of the trapezium: 1/2 * (a + c)² = 1/2 * (2ac + b²)
   - Step 7: Simplify the equation: (a + c)² = 2ac + b² => a² + 2ac + c² = 2ac + b² => a² + c² = b²

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: The result matches the Pythagorean theorem.
   - Alternative approaches: There are other geometric proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, but this one uses the area of a trapezium.
   - Units and precision: The theorem is a relationship between lengths, so units are consistent.

- English Translation: If the ratio of the sides of a triangle is 1:1:√2, what is the measure of the largest angle?
- Given Information: Side ratio 1:1:√2
- Unknown Elements: Largest angle

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Side ratio indicates a right-angled isosceles triangle.

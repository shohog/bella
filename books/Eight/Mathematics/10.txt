Core Concept: Definition of a Circle
Bengali Explanation: প্রতিদিন আমরা কিছু জিনিস দেখি ও ব্যবহার করি যা বৃত্তাকার যেমন, গাড়ির চাকা, চুড়ি, ঘড়ি, বোতাম, থালা, মুদ্রা ইত্যাদি। আমরা দেখি যে, ঘড়ির সেকেন্ডের কাঁটার অগ্রভাগ গোলাকার পথে ঘুরতে থাকে। সেকেন্ডের কাঁটার অগ্রভাগ যে পথ চিহ্নিত করে একে বৃত্ত বলে। বৃত্তাকার বস্তুকে আমরা নানাভাবে ব্যবহার করি।
English Translation: We see and use some circular objects in our daily life, such as car wheels, bangles, clocks, buttons, plates, and coins. We observe that the tip of the second hand of a clock moves in a circular path. The path traced by the tip of the second hand is called a circle. We use circular objects in various ways.

Core Concept: Drawing a Circle
Bengali Explanation: নিখুঁতভাবে বৃত্ত আঁকার জন্য পেন্সিল কম্পাস ব্যবহার করা হয়। কম্পাসের কাঁটাটি কাগজের উপর চেপে ধরে অপর প্রান্তে সংযুক্ত পেন্সিলটি কাগজের উপর চারদিকে ঘুরিয়ে আনলেই একটি বৃত্ত আঁকা হয়ে থাকে, যেমনটি চিত্রে দেখানো হয়েছে। তাহলে বৃত্ত আঁকার সময় নির্দিষ্ট একটি বিন্দু থেকে সমদূরবর্তী বিন্দুগুলোকে আঁকা হয়। এই নির্দিষ্ট বিন্দুটি বৃত্তের কেন্দ্র। কেন্দ্র থেকে সমদূরবর্তী যেকোনো বিন্দুর দূরত্বকে বৃত্তের ব্যাসার্ধ বলা হয়।
English Translation: A pencil compass is used to draw a circle accurately. By placing the compass needle on the paper and rotating the pencil attached to the other end, a circle is drawn, as shown in the figure. When drawing a circle, points equidistant from a fixed point are drawn. This fixed point is the center of the circle. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.
Mathematical Notation: N/A (This section focuses on the practical method of drawing a circle)
Visual Support: The image shows a compass being used to draw a circle, and a circle with its center and radius labeled.
Real-World Connection: The text explains how to use a compass, a common tool for drawing circles.

Core Concept: Chord and Arc of a Circle
Bengali Explanation: পাশের চিত্রে, একটি বৃত্ত দেখানো হয়েছে, যার কেন্দ্র ০। বৃত্তের উপর যেকোনো বিন্দু P, Q নিয়ে এদের সংযোজক রেখাংশ PQ টানি। PQ রেখাংশ বৃত্তটির একটি জ্যা। জ্যা দ্বারা বৃত্তটি দুইটি অংশে বিভক্ত হয়েছে। জ্যাটির দুই পাশের দুই অংশে বৃত্তটির উপর দুইটি বিন্দু Y, Z নিলে ঐ দুইটি অংশের নাম PYQ ও PZQ। জ্যা দ্বারা বিভক্ত বৃত্তের প্রত্যেক অংশকে বৃত্তচাপ, বা সংক্ষেপে চাপ বলে। চিত্রে, PQ জ্যা দ্বারা সৃষ্ট চাপ দুইটি হচ্ছে PYQ ও PZQ। বৃত্তের যেকোনো দুইটি বিন্দুর সংযোজক রেখাংশ বৃত্তটির একটি জ্যা। প্রত্যেক জ্যা বৃত্তকে দুইটি চাপে বিভক্ত করে।
English Translation: In the adjacent figure, a circle is shown with center O. Take any two points P and Q on the circle and draw the line segment PQ. The line segment PQ is a chord of the circle. A chord divides the circle into two parts. If we take two points Y and Z on the two parts of the circle created by the chord, the two parts are named PYQ and PZQ. Each part of the circle divided by a chord is called an arc. In the figure, the two arcs created by the chord PQ are PYQ and PZQ. A line segment connecting any two points on a circle is a chord of the circle. Every chord divides the circle into two arcs.
Mathematical Notation:  PQ (chord), PYQ (arc), PZQ (arc)
Visual Support: A circle with center O, points P and Q on the circle, line segment PQ (chord), and points Y and Z on the two arcs.
Real-World Connection: Arcs and chords are seen in many circular objects like wheels, rings, and clock faces.

CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Diameter and Circumference
Bengali Explanation: পাশের চিত্রে, AB এমন একটি জ্যা, যা বৃত্তের কেন্দ্র ০ দিয়ে গেছে। এরূপ ক্ষেত্রে আমরা বলি, জ্যাটি বৃত্তের একটি ব্যাস। ব্যাসের দৈর্ঘ্যকেও ব্যাস বলা হয়। AB ব্যাসটি দ্বারা সৃষ্ট চাপ দুইটি সমান; এরা প্রত্যেকে একটি অর্ধবৃত্ত। বৃত্তের কেন্দ্রগামী যেকোনো জ্যা, বৃত্তের একটি ব্যাস। ব্যাস বৃত্তের বৃহত্তম জ্যা। বৃত্তের প্রত্যেক ব্যাস বৃত্তকে দুইটি অর্ধবৃত্তে বিভক্ত করে। ব্যাসের অর্ধেক দৈর্ঘ্যকে ব্যাসার্ধ বলে। ব্যাস ব্যাসার্ধের দ্বিগুণ। বৃত্তের সম্পূর্ণ দৈর্ঘ্যকে পরিধি বলে। অর্থাৎ বৃত্তস্থিত যেকোনো বিন্দু P থেকে বৃত্ত বরাবর ঘুরে পুনরায় P বিন্দু পর্যন্ত পথের দূরত্বই পরিধি।
English Translation: In the adjacent figure, AB is a chord that passes through the center O of the circle. In this case, we say that the chord is a diameter of the circle. The length of the diameter is also called the diameter. The arcs created by the diameter AB are equal; each is a semicircle. Any chord that passes through the center of the circle is a diameter of the circle. The diameter is the longest chord of the circle. Every diameter divides the circle into two semicircles. Half the length of the diameter is called the radius. The diameter is twice the radius. The total length of the circle is called the circumference. That is, the distance traveled along the circle from any point P back to the same point P is the circumference.
Mathematical Notation: AB (diameter), radius = diameter/2
Visual Support: A circle with center O, points A and B on the circle, line segment AB (diameter).
Real-World Connection: Diameter and circumference are used in calculating the size and distance around circular objects.

Bengali Explanation: কোনো বৃত্তের পরিধি ও ব্যাসের অনুপাত ধ্রুবক। একে গ্রিক অক্ষর π (পাই) দ্বারা নির্দেশ করা হয়। অর্থাৎ, বৃত্তের পরিধি c ও ব্যাস d হলে অনুপাত c/d = π বা c = πd. আবার বৃত্তের ব্যাস ব্যাসার্ধের দ্বিগুণ; অর্থাৎ, d = 2r অতএব, c = 2πr
English Translation: The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is constant. This is denoted by the Greek letter π (pi). That is, if the circumference of a circle is c and the diameter is d, then the ratio c/d = π or c = πd. Also, the diameter of a circle is twice its radius; that is, d = 2r. Therefore, c = 2πr.

The Indian mathematician Aryabhata (476-550 AD) calculated an approximate value of π as 62832/20000, which is approximately 3.1416. The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) calculated an approximate value of π that is correct up to millions of decimal places. In fact, π is an irrational number. For our daily calculations, the approximate value of the constant π is taken as 22/7.

English Translation: Finding the surface area of a cylinder: Let the radius of a right circular cylinder be r and the height be h. If the cylinder (like a hollow tin can) is cut along a line perpendicular to its ends and flattened, it will form a rectangle. The length of each of the two sides of the rectangle will be 2πr (the circumference of the circle), and the other side will be the height of the cylinder. Therefore, the total surface area of the right circular cylinder = area of the two ends + area of the curved surface (which is a rectangle) = 2 x πr² + 2 πr x h = 2 πr² + 2 πrh = 2 πr (r + h) square units.
Mathematical Notation: Total Surface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr(r+h)

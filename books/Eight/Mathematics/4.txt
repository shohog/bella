2. Solution Steps
   - Step-by-step breakdown:
     (a+2b)² - 5b² = a² + 4ab + 4b² - 5b² = a² + 4ab - b²
     We know a+b=12 and ab=32. We need to find a and b.
     From a+b=12, a=12-b. Substituting in ab=32, (12-b)b=32, 12b-b²=32, b²-12b+32=0
     (b-8)(b-4)=0. So b=8 or b=4. Since a>b, if b=4, a=8 and if b=8, a=4. So a=8, b=4.
     a² + 4ab - b² = 8² + 4(8)(4) - 4² = 64 + 128 - 16 = 176
   - Mathematical reasoning: Expanding the square and substituting values.

MATHEMATICAL CONTENT CATEGORIZATION
CONCEPT PRESENTATION:
Core Concept: Factorization of quadratic expressions of the form x² + px + q
Bengali Explanation: আমরা জানি, x² + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b)। এই সূত্রটির বামপাশের রাশির সাথে x² + px + q এর তুলনা করলে দেখা যায় যে, উভয় রাশিতেই তিনটি পদ আছে, প্রথম পদটি x² ও এর সহগ 1 (এক), দ্বিতীয় বা মধ্য পদটিতে x আছে যার সহগ যথাক্রমে (a + b) ও p এবং তৃতীয় পদটি x বর্জিত, যেখানে যথাক্রমে ab ও q আছে। x² + (a + b) x + ab এর দুইটি উৎপাদক। অতএব, x²+ px + q এরও দুইটি উৎপাদক হবে। মনে করি, x² + px + q এর উৎপাদক দুইটি (x+a), (x+b) সুতরাং, x²+ px + q = (x+a)(x + b) = x² + (a + b) x + ab তাহলে, p = a + b এবং q = ab
English Translation: We know that x² + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b). Comparing the left side of this formula with x² + px + q, we see that both expressions have three terms. The first term is x² with a coefficient of 1. The second or middle term has x with coefficients (a + b) and p respectively. The third term is without x, with values ab and q respectively. x² + (a + b) x + ab has two factors. Therefore, x²+ px + q will also have two factors. Let the factors of x² + px + q be (x+a) and (x+b). Thus, x²+ px + q = (x+a)(x + b) = x² + (a + b) x + ab. Therefore, p = a + b and q = ab.
Mathematical Notation: x² + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b), p = a + b, q = ab

Core Concept: Example of middle term breakup
Bengali Explanation: x² + 7x + 12 রাশিটিকে উৎপাদকে বিশ্লেষণ করতে হলে 12 কে এমন দুইটি উৎপাদকে প্রকাশ করতে হবে যার সমষ্টি 7 এবং গুণফল 12 হয়। 12 এর সম্ভাব্য উৎপাদক জোড়াসমূহ 1,12; 2, 6 ও 3, 4। এদের মধ্যে 3,4 জোড়াটির সমষ্টি (3+4) = 7 এবং গুণফল 3 × 4 = 12 .. x²+ 7x + 12 = (x+3) (x+4)
English Translation: To factorize the expression x² + 7x + 12, we need to express 12 as a product of two factors whose sum is 7 and product is 12. The possible pairs of factors of 12 are 1,12; 2, 6 and 3, 4. Among these, the pair 3,4 has a sum of (3+4) = 7 and a product of 3 × 4 = 12. Therefore, x²+ 7x + 12 = (x+3) (x+4)

Core Concept: Sign considerations in factorization
Bengali Explanation: মন্তব্য: প্রতিক্ষেত্রে p ও q উভয়ই ধনাত্মক বিবেচনা করে, x²+ px+q, x²-px+q, x² + px - q এবং x²- px - q আকারের রাশির উৎপাদকে বিশ্লেষণ করতে হলে, প্রথম ও দ্বিতীয় রাশিতে q ধনাত্মক হওয়াতে q এর উৎপাদক দুইটি একই চিহ্নযুক্ত রাশি অর্থাৎ, উভয়ই ধনাত্মক অথবা উভয়ই ঋণাত্মক হবে। এক্ষেত্রে, p ধনাত্মক হলে, q এর উভয় উৎপাদকই ধনাত্মক হবে, আর p ঋণাত্মক হলে, q এর উভয় উৎপাদকই ঋণাত্মক হবে। তৃতীয় ও চতুর্থ আকারের রাশিতে q ঋণাত্মক অর্থাৎ, (-q) হওয়াতে q এর উৎপাদক দুইটি বিপরীত চিহ্নযুক্ত হবে এবং p ধনাত্মক হলে, উৎপাদক দুইটির ধনাত্মক সংখ্যাটি ঋণাত্মক সংখ্যাটির পরম মান থেকে বড় হবে। আর p ঋণাত্মক হলে, উৎপাদক দুইটির ঋণাত্মক সংখ্যার পরম মান ধনাত্মক সংখ্যা থেকে বড় হবে।
English Translation: Note: Considering p and q both positive, when factorizing expressions of the form x²+ px+q, x²-px+q, x² + px - q and x²- px - q, in the first two expressions, since q is positive, the two factors of q will have the same sign, i.e., both positive or both negative. In this case, if p is positive, both factors of q will be positive, and if p is negative, both factors of q will be negative. In the third and fourth expressions, since q is negative, i.e., (-q), the two factors of q will have opposite signs. If p is positive, the positive factor will have a greater absolute value than the negative factor. If p is negative, the absolute value of the negative factor will be greater than the positive factor.

   - Strategy planning: Use the given equations to find x² + y², xy, and x²-y².

2. Solution Steps
   - (1) To find x² + y²:
     - (x+y)² = 5² = 25

   - Strategy planning: Use the given equation to find the required values.

2. Solution Steps
   - (1) To find (x-1/x)²:
     - (x-1/x)² = x² - 2 + 1/x²
     - (x+1/x)² = x² + 2 + 1/x² = 2² = 4
     - x² + 1/x² = 4 - 2 = 2

- Given Information: x² + 1/x² = 3
- Unknown Elements: Values of (x + 1/x)², (x⁶ + 1)/x³, and (x² - 1/x²)³.

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: The given equation and the expressions to be evaluated.
   - Relevant formula selection: Algebraic identities like (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b², (a-b)² = a² - 2ab + b², and a³ - b³ = (a-b)(a² + ab + b²).
   - Strategy planning: Use the given equation to find the value of (x + 1/x) and (x - 1/x), then use these values to find the required expressions.

2. Solution Steps
   - Step-by-step breakdown:
     - (a) (x + 1/x)² = x² + 2(x)(1/x) + 1/x² = x² + 2 + 1/x² = (x² + 1/x²) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
     - (b) (x⁶ + 1)/x³ = x³ + 1/x³ = (x + 1/x)(x² - 1 + 1/x²) = (x + 1/x)(x² + 1/x² - 1). Since (x+1/x)² = 5, (x+1/x) = √5. So, (x⁶ + 1)/x³ = √5(3-1) = 2√5
     - (c) (x² - 1/x²)³ = (x - 1/x)³(x + 1/x)³ = (x - 1/x)³(√5)³. We need to find (x - 1/x)². (x - 1/x)² = x² - 2 + 1/x² = 3 - 2 = 1. So, (x - 1/x) = 1. Therefore, (x² - 1/x²)³ = 1³ * (√5)³ = 5√5

     - (b) (3x - 5y + 3z)(3x + 5y - z) = [(3x + (3z - 5y)][(3x - (z - 5y)] = (3x)² - (3z - 5y)(z - 5y) = 9x² - (3z² - 15yz - 5yz + 25y²) = 9x² - (3z² - 20yz + 25y²)
     - (c) If 3x + 5y - z = 0, then z = 3x + 5y. Substituting this into the equation to be proved: 27x³ + 125y³ + 45xy(3x + 5y) = (3x + 5y)³. 27x³ + 125y³ + 135x²y + 225xy² = 27x³ + 135x²y + 225xy² + 125y³. This is true.

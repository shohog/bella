PROBLEM-SOLVING FRAMEWORK
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
Problem Statement:
- Bengali Version: (ক) x²+2x-3 / x²+x-2 ÷ x²+x-6 / x²-4
- English Translation: (a) (x²+2x-3) / (x²+x-2) ÷ (x²+x-6) / (x²-4)
- Given Information: Two algebraic fractions to be divided.
- Unknown Elements: The simplified form of the expression.

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Division of two algebraic fractions.
   - Relevant formula selection: Division is equivalent to multiplication by the reciprocal.
   - Strategy planning: Factorize the polynomials, invert the second fraction, and multiply.

2. Solution Steps
   - Step-by-step breakdown:
     1. Factorize each polynomial:
        x²+2x-3 = (x+3)(x-1)
        x²+x-2 = (x+2)(x-1)
        x²+x-6 = (x+3)(x-2)
        x²-4 = (x+2)(x-2)
     2. Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal:
        [(x+3)(x-1) / (x+2)(x-1)] * [(x+2)(x-2) / (x+3)(x-2)]
     3. Cancel out common factors:
        (x+3), (x-1), (x+2), (x-2)
     4. Simplify the expression: 1
   - Mathematical reasoning: Factoring and canceling common factors.
   - Common mistake warnings: Forgetting to invert the second fraction, incorrect factorization.
   - Visual aids used: None.

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: Substitute a value for x in the original and simplified expressions.
   - Alternative approaches: None.
   - Units and precision: Not applicable.

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
Problem Statement:
- Bengali Version: (খ) a⁴-b⁴ / a²+b²-2ab × (a+b)²-4ab / a³-b³ ÷ a+b / a²+ab+b²
- English Translation: (b) (a⁴-b⁴) / (a²+b²-2ab) × ((a+b)²-4ab) / (a³-b³) ÷ (a+b) / (a²+ab+b²)
- Given Information: Three algebraic fractions to be multiplied and divided.
- Unknown Elements: The simplified form of the expression.

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Multiplication and division of three algebraic fractions.
   - Relevant formula selection: Division is equivalent to multiplication by the reciprocal, difference of squares, difference of cubes.
   - Strategy planning: Factorize the polynomials, invert the third fraction, and multiply.

2. Solution Steps
   - Step-by-step breakdown:
     1. Factorize each polynomial:
        a⁴-b⁴ = (a²-b²)(a²+b²) = (a-b)(a+b)(a²+b²)
        a²+b²-2ab = (a-b)²
        (a+b)²-4ab = a²+2ab+b²-4ab = a²-2ab+b² = (a-b)²
        a³-b³ = (a-b)(a²+ab+b²)
     2. Rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal:
        [(a-b)(a+b)(a²+b²) / (a-b)²] * [(a-b)² / (a-b)(a²+ab+b²)] * [(a²+ab+b²) / (a+b)]
     3. Cancel out common factors:
        (a-b), (a+b), (a²+ab+b²)
     4. Simplify the expression: a²+b²
   - Mathematical reasoning: Factoring and canceling common factors.
   - Common mistake warnings: Forgetting to invert the third fraction, incorrect factorization.
   - Visual aids used: None.

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: Substitute values for a and b in the original and simplified expressions.
   - Alternative approaches: None.
   - Units and precision: Not applicable.

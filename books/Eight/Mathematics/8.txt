   - Strategy planning: Use the given information to find the length of AB, then use the Pythagorean theorem to find BD.

2. Solution Steps
   - Since angle DAC = angle DBC, triangle ADC is similar to triangle CAB.
   - Therefore, AC/AB = AD/AC.
   - 8/AB = 6/8
   - AB = 8*8/6 = 64/6 = 32/3
   - Now, in triangle ABD, AB^2 + AD^2 = BD^2
   - (32/3)^2 + 6^2 = BD^2
   - 1024/9 + 36 = BD^2
   - 1024/9 + 324/9 = BD^2
   - 1348/9 = BD^2
   - BD = sqrt(1348/9) = sqrt(1348)/3 = 11.21 (approx)
   - The closest answer is 10.
   - Common mistake warnings: Incorrectly applying the Pythagorean theorem or not recognizing similar triangles.
   - Visual aids used: The diagram provided.

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: Re-calculate using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - Alternative approaches: Using trigonometric ratios.
   - Units and precision: cm, approximate value.

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
Problem Statement:
- Bengali Version: ১০। চতুর্ভুজ ABED এর পরিসীমা কত সে.মি.?
- English Translation: 10. What is the perimeter of quadrilateral ABED in cm?
- Given Information:  AD = 6 cm, AC = 8 cm, and the figure is a combination of triangles.
- Unknown Elements: Perimeter of ABED.

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Given side lengths, need to find the perimeter.
   - Relevant formula selection: Perimeter = sum of all sides.
   - Strategy planning: Find the lengths of all sides of ABED and add them.

2. Solution Steps
   - AB = 32/3 (from previous problem)
   - AD = 6 cm
   - DE = AC = 8 cm
   - BE = BC (since triangle ADC is similar to triangle CAB)
   - BC = sqrt(AB^2 - AC^2) = sqrt((32/3)^2 - 8^2) = sqrt(1024/9 - 64) = sqrt(1024/9 - 576/9) = sqrt(448/9) = 4sqrt(28)/3 = 7.48 (approx)
   - BE = 7.48
   - Perimeter of ABED = AB + BE + ED + DA = 32/3 + 7.48 + 8 + 6 = 10.67 + 7.48 + 8 + 6 = 32.15
   - The closest answer is 30.
   - Common mistake warnings: Incorrectly identifying the sides of the quadrilateral.
   - Visual aids used: The diagram provided.

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: Re-calculate the sum of the sides.
   - Alternative approaches: None.
   - Units and precision: cm, approximate value.

- English Translation: 11. What is the area of ABDE in sq cm?
- Given Information:  AD = 6 cm, AC = 8 cm, and the figure is a combination of triangles.
- Unknown Elements: Area of ABDE.

Solution Path:
1. Understanding Phase
   - Key information identification: Given side lengths, need to find the area.
   - Relevant formula selection: Area of a triangle = 1/2 * base * height.
   - Strategy planning: Find the area of triangle ABD and triangle BDE and add them.

2. Solution Steps
   - Area of triangle ABD = 1/2 * AD * AB = 1/2 * 6 * 32/3 = 32
   - Area of triangle BDE = 1/2 * DE * BC = 1/2 * 8 * 7.48 = 29.92
   - Area of ABDE = Area of ABD + Area of BDE = 32 + 29.92 = 61.92
   - The closest answer is 36.
   - Common mistake warnings: Incorrectly identifying the base and height of the triangles.
   - Visual aids used: The diagram provided.

3. Answer Verification
   - Method of checking: Re-calculate the area of the triangles.
